In this study, we investigate the limitations of these strategies and propose a solution. Our literature review reveals that the volatile profits are due to statistical analyses that assume the persistence of past patterns, leading to unreliable results in out-of-sample scenarios when underlying mechanisms evolve. Statistical analysis, the predominant method in financial economics, often proves inadequate in explaining market fluctuations and predicting crashes. To overcome these limitations, a paradigm shift towards dynamic approaches is essential. Drawing inspiration from three groundbreaking economists, we introduce the extended Samuelson model (ESM), a dynamic model that connects price changes to market participant actions. This paradigm transition uncovers several significant findings. First, timely signals indicate momentum initiations, cessations, and reversals, validated using S&P 500 data from 1999 to 2023. Second, ESM predicts the 1987 Black Monday crash weeks in advance, offering a new perspective on its underlying cause. Third, we classify sequential stock price data into eight distinct market states, including their thresholds for transitions, laying the groundwork for market trend predictions and risk assessments. Fourth, the ESM is shown to be a compelling alternative to EMH, offering potent explanatory and predictive power based on a single, realistic assumption. Our findings suggest that ESM has the potential to provide policymakers with proactive tools, enabling financial institutions to enhance their risk assessment and management strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1987 Black Monday; Asymmetric Information; Behavior Finance Theory; Boom And Bust; Efficient Market Hypothesis; Excess Demand; Herding Effect; Investor Behavior; Market Crisis; Market Maker’s Inventory; Market Microstructure; Momentum Strategy; Noise Trade; Risk Assessment; Samuelson’s Model; Sentiment; Warren Buffett","","","","We are grateful to Editor Gang Kou and the eight anonymous reviewers for their time and dedication throughout the rigorous five-round review process.

Whereas voluntary turnover has been extensively studied, less attention has been given to involuntary turnover (ITO), particularly the decision-making processes of direct supervisors and the influence of sociopolitical factors. In response, we introduce a recognition-primed process model that describes how supervisors navigate ITO decisions within the sociopolitical context of organizational life. The model outlines four decision paths shaped by ITO triggers, decision schemas and experience, cognitive assessments, and mental simulation. We further apply a sociopolitical lens from the human resource (HR) literature to show how social and political dynamics—e.g., supervisor-employee relationships (perceived similarity, effective impression management tactics, and resource dependence), supervisor-context interface (influential audience reactions), and supervisor characteristics (political skills, locus of control, and uncertainty intolerance)—influence distinct decision paths. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dismissals; Involuntary Turnover; Layoffs; Recognition-primed Decisions; Sociopolitical Factors","","","","","Alekseeva, Liudmila, The demand for AI skills in the labor market, Labour Economics, 71, (2021); Alves, Hans, My friends are all alike - the relation between liking and perceived similarity in person perception, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 62, pp. 103-117, (2016); Research in Organizational Behavior, (1985); Academy of Management Review, (1984); Bachkirov, Alexandre A., Managerial decision making under specific emotions, Journal of Managerial Psychology, 30, 7, pp. 861-874, (2015); Balliet, Daniel P., Ingroup favoritism in cooperation: a meta-analysis, Psychological Bulletin, 140, 6, pp. 1556-1581, (2014); Barrick, Murray R., ANTECEDENTS OF INVOLUNTARY TURNOVER DUE TO A REDUCTION IN FORCE, Personnel Psychology, 47, 3, pp. 515-535, (1994); Batt, Rosemary, An employment systems approach to turnover: Human resources practices, quits, dismissals, and performance, Academy of Management Journal, 54, 4, pp. 695-717, (2011); Image Theory Decision Making in Personal and Organizational Contexts, (1990); Managing Human Assets, (1984)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","10534822","","HRMRE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013643715"

In contrast to previous green finance policies that relied on a single financial instrument, Chinese government implemented the Green Financial Reform and Innovation Pilot Zones (GFRIPZ) policy in 2017, a new diversified green finance policy. Our paper examines whether green finance from GFRIPZ policy affects firm cash holdings, known as the firm “lifeblood”. The findings document that the firms located in cities implementing GFRIPZ policy hold fewer cash holdings than other firms do after policy year. Specifically, green finance reduces firm cash holdings by 8.54% of the sample mean. Additionally, this effect is attributed to relaxation of credit constraints, or enhancement of sustainable transformation, and this effect would be enhanced by a high informal credit market, high internal governance, high operational stability. Overall, this paper reveals the firm cash holding effects of a new diversified green finance policy from developing countries, which provides empirical evidence for sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (grant no. 2024J08282) and the Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province (grant no.

Based on the above, it analyzes 147 firms from 2016 to 2023, identifying their financial trends and categorizing them into distressed, gray, and safe zones. This is a dual-model approach designed to bridge this important gap in the literature with actionable insights on the vulnerabilities of a sector vital for both economic stability and food security for the nation of Colombia. Results show that 64.57% of firms each year fall into a safe zone characterized by excellent financial health and stability against adverse conditions. About 20.41% fall within the gray zone, representing moderate financial health with the potential to slide further without timely and appropriate interventions. While the remaining 16.07% represent the distressed zone, they show imminent signs of insolvency or default. Including variables like solvency and profitability trends in the Ohlson model increases its predictive sensitivity and, therefore, identifies a slightly higher percentage of distressed firms than the Z''-Score model. They provide recommendations regarding the improvement of credit access, enabling innovation, and restructuring operational areas to consolidate profitability and both short- and long-term solvency. The same idea can be further checked by using more advanced predictive tools like hybrid models and longitudinal analyses in future studies. Such a finding provides a full-scale framework of analysis regarding financial health. It boosts interest by policymakers and stakeholders in the sustainable development of industries supporting food production in Colombia among firms operating in emerging markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Altman’s Z-score Ems; Colombian Economy; Financial Distress; Food Production Sector; Ohlson’s O-score; Developing World; Finance; Food Production; Model; Prediction; Colombia","developing world; finance; food production; model; prediction; Colombia","","","","Swalih, M.

Our findings indicate that innovation is associated with nuanced relationships with bank performance indicators, and innovation potentially increases (decreases) performance via the return on asssets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), Tobin's Q, and stock market returns. Our analysis demonstrates that uncertainty plays a complex role in influencing bank performance. It has a negative impact on economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and the World Uncertainty Index (WUI), but a positive impact on geopolitical risk (GPR). However, we observe an interaction effect, which suggests that uncertainty has the potential to either diminish or amplify the impact of innovation on bank performance metrics. Specifically, the relationship between innovation and bank performance, whether negative or positive, is influenced by the presence of uncertainty. This nuanced interaction highlights the dynamic nature of the relationship between innovation and bank performance, as it is contingent on the prevailing level of uncertainty. Therefore, fostering an environment in the banking sector that is conducive to growth and stability is crucial for enhancing innovation, minimizing uncertainty, and improving bank performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global Innovation Index; Mena; Performance; Uncertainty","","","","","Hakimi, Abdelaziz, The Interactional Relationships Between Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk and Bank Profitability in MENA Region, Global Business Review, 23, 3, pp. 561-583, (2022); Adelopo, Ismail, Determinants of bank profitability before, during, and after the financial crisis, International Journal of Managerial Finance, 14, 4, pp. 378-398, (2018); Adra, Samer, Geopolitical risk and corporate payout policy, International Review of Financial Analysis, 87, (2023); undefined, (2018); Akinci, Özge, How effective are macroprudential policies?

Although the energy transition offers various opportunities, a full shift to a net-zero emissions system remains unfeasible in the near term, and the recent geopolitical tensions remark a still strong reliance of the global economy on fossil fuels. In this paper, we develop a measure of media attention to environmental risk and dynamically assess its impact on the financial performance of energy stocks. Specifically, we build a Green Transition Attention Index (GTAI) by scraping headlines from The Wall Street Journal, a key resource for global investors, and use it to model the company's financial returns within an asset pricing framework, subsetting results by region and energy sub-sector. The findings reveal a time-dependent relationship, with varying impact in both sign and magnitude. This suggests the GTAI as a tool for investors to navigate uncertainty, protect portfolios, and seize opportunities during the energy market's transition toward identifying the dominant energy source of the coming decades. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Pricing; Energy; Green Transition; Web Scraping; Costs; Energy Policy; Green Economy; Investments; Power Markets; Asset Pricing; Energy; Energy Markets; Energy Sector; Energy Transitions; Environmental Concerns; Full-shift; Green Transitions; Investment Strategy; Web Scrapings; Risk Assessment; Energy Storage; Environmental Risk; Fossil Fuel; Global Economy; Pricing Policy; Risk Assessment; Spotlight Survey","Costs; Energy policy; Green economy; Investments; Power markets; Asset pricing; Energy; Energy markets; Energy sector; Energy transitions; Environmental concerns; Full-shift; Green transitions; Investment strategy; Web scrapings; Risk assessment; energy storage; environmental risk; fossil fuel; global economy; pricing policy; risk assessment; spotlight survey","","","","de Nard, Gianluca, Factor-Mimicking Portfolios for Climate Risk, Financial Analysts Journal, 80, 3, pp. 37-58, (2024); Engle, Robert F., Hedging climate change news, Review of Financial Studies, 33, 3, pp. 1184-1216, (2020); Venturini, Alessio, Climate change, risk factors and stock returns: A review of the literature, International Review of Financial Analysis, 79, (2022); Tetlock, Paul C., Does public financial news resolve asymmetric information?, Review of Financial Studies, 23, 9, pp. 3520-3557, (2010); Pedersen, Lasse Heje, Game on: Social networks and markets, Journal of Financial Economics, 146, 3, pp. 1097-1119, (2022); Münster, Markus, Robinhood, Reddit, and the news: The impact of traditional and social media on retail investor trading, Journal of Financial Markets, 71, (2024); Warkulat, Sonja, Social media attention and retail investor behavior: Evidence from r/wallstreetbets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 96, (2024); Kumar, Alok, Retail investor sentiment and return comovements, Journal of Finance, 61, 5, pp. 2451-2486, (2006); Tetlock, Paul C., Giving content to investor sentiment: The role of media in the stock market, Journal of Finance, 62, 3, pp. 1139-1168, (2007); Barber, Brad M., Do retail trades move markets?, Review of Financial Studies, 22, 1, pp. 151-186, (2009)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03605442; 18736785","0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808","ENEYD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014622874"

Based on this, it further explores the mediating role of organizational resilience and the moderating role of environmental uncertainty. Using data from Chinese A-share-listed manufacturing companies from 2010 to 2020, we find that CEO ability promotes ESG responsibility fulfillment, and organizational resilience mediates this relationship. Furthermore, the promotion effect of CEO ability on ESG responsibility fulfillment through organizational resilience is stronger under high environmental uncertainty. Additionally, the influence of CEO ability on ESG responsibility fulfillment is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises and low environmental sensitivity industries. Our study opens the “black box” of the mechanism between CEO ability and ESG responsibility fulfillment and provides practical implications for organizations, managers, and policymakers to promote ESG responsibility fulfillment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Ability; Environmental Uncertainty; Esg Responsibility Fulfillment; Organizational Resilience","","","","This research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (grant number 22BGL201).","Amorelli, María Florencia, Leadership in heels: Women on boards and sustainability in times of COVID-19, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 30, 4, pp. 1987-2010, (2023); Anderson, Lindsey B., Communicating stakeholder resilience: understanding how resilience discourse can build a fully functioning society, Journal of Public Relations Research, 33, 1, pp. 23-38, (2021); Bag, Surajit, Change adaptation capability, business-to-business marketing capability and firm performance: Integrating institutional theory and dynamic capability view, Industrial Marketing Management, 115, pp. 470-483, (2023); Sci Technol Manag Res, (2024); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

Design/methodology/approach This study gathered data from 272 participants who are working in the operational Islamic banks in Jordan. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is used for the hypotheses testing. Findings The results indicate that cultural sensitivity plays a significant role in shaping the UX, consequently influencing perceptions of financial transparency and accountability in e-Islamic finance within the metaverse. This study underscores the intricate interplay between technological advancements, adherence to Sharia principles and diverse cultural expectations, forming the crux of the research. Originality/value This research brings a novel perspective by examining the complex connections among technology adoption, UX, financial transparency and accountability, specifically within the distinctive context of Jordan. This research study innovates by checking out how social sensitivity moderates these partnerships, specifically in the context of e-Islamic finance in the metaverse. It adds value to the academic area by shedding light on the intricate interaction between technological development, adherence to Sharia concepts and differing cultural expectations.

Scholars suggest that established firms can gain product-related insights by working with user communities and studies documenting various ways of working with users, as well as managers' interest in doing so. However, the link between working with user communities for product development purposes and its value for firms is not established. Coupling the use of event study methodology and regression analysis, I examine stock market reactions to corporate announcements stating that the firm is contributing software code to the community. I find that when firms state that generating insights from users regarding new and improved features and functionality is a motivation for contributing code, the market's reaction to the announcement is greater than for announcements that do not state this goal.

This research reveals that external ESG rating events enhance technological innovation in China's NEV sector, as evidenced by a series of robustness tests confirming the validity of the baseline DID results. Specifically, these events can boost green patent applications, stimulate collaborative patent applications, and augment the number of high-quality patents. Heterogeneity analysis reveals a distinct dichotomy: ESG rating events improve innovation quality among state-owned NEV enterprises whereas they predominantly drive the quantity of innovation among non-state-owned NEV counterparts. In addition, the green awareness of executives within NEV firms magnifies the innovation-driving effect of ESG rating events, with channel tests indicating that these events promote innovation by increasing R & D investment and expanding the quantity of R&D personnel. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esg Rating; New Energy Vehicle Industry; Technological Innovation; Engineering Research; Investments; Patents And Inventions; Esg Rating; High Quality; New Energy Vehicle Industry; New Energy Vehicles; Patent Applications; Rapid Expansion; Related Factors; Robustness Tests; Technological Innovation; Vehicle Industry; Vehicles","Engineering research; Investments; Patents and inventions; ESG rating; High quality; New energy vehicle industry; New energy vehicles; Patent applications; Rapid expansion; Related factors; Robustness tests; Technological innovation; Vehicle industry; Vehicles","","","Guangdong Office of Philosophy and Social Science (GD24XYJ37).Department of Education of Guangdong Province (2023WQNCX041).The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Yu Fan reports financial support was provided by Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science.

We leverage data on carbon emissions from more than 900 listed companies from 2007 to 2022. We explore how firm-specific carbon risk factors may impact FDI and show that carbon risk constrains firms’ FDI through increased carbon costs from regulations and earnings uncertainty. The findings hold across alternative measures of carbon emission intensity, various model specifications, and after considering potential endogeneity issues. We also show that carbon risk originates primarily from carbon emissions caused by the corporate combustion of fuels. For firms under mandatory governmental disclosure of environmental information, the negative effect of carbon risk on FDI is relatively modest. Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that FDI is more adversely affected by carbon risk when invested in host countries with stringent environmental performance, industries with high-polluting, or state-owned enterprises. This study contributes to the literature by (1) providing a novel perspective of carbon risks to investigate their influence on FDI, (2) conducting micro firm-level analysis by manually collecting firm-level data, and (3) identifying two underlying mechanisms including increased carbon costs from regulations and earnings uncertainty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Risk; China; Emissions Trading System; Fdi; Listed Company; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Economy; Carbon Emissions; Commerce; Cost Benefit Analysis; Emission Control; Investments; Risk Analysis; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty Analysis; Zero-carbon; Carbon Costs; Carbon Emission Trading; Carbon Risk; China; Emission Trading Systems; Foreign Direct Investments; Listed Company; Risk Factors; Uncertainty; Environmental Management; Carbon Emission; Emissions Trading; Foreign Direct Investment; Risk Factor","Carbon; Carbon cycle; Carbon Economy; Carbon emissions; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Investments; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Zero-carbon; Carbon costs; Carbon emission trading; Carbon risk; China; Emission trading systems; Foreign direct investments; Listed company; Risk factors; Uncertainty; Environmental management; carbon emission; emissions trading; foreign direct investment; risk factor","","","Jiaxuan Gao gratefully acknowledges the financial support by National Social Science Fund of China (Nr. 22BJL037 ).

This ongoing debate arises from two main limitations, namely a primary focus on conventional banks, which overlooks the distinct risk-sharing principles of Islamic banks, and the widespread assumption of linear relationships, disregarding essential threshold effects. Departing from traditional econometric approaches, this study employs a causal inference framework to reveal how diversification's effects on Islamic banks' stability fundamentally reverse across intensity levels. Our analysis demonstrates a critical dichotomy: while moderate diversification enhances stability, excessive diversification undermines it. Utilizing aggregate-level data from 13 countries (2013Q4–2022Q4), we employ the generalized propensity score-dose response function (GPS-DRF) approach, which effectively captures curvilinear relationships between diversification and stability. Our findings, which remain robust across multiple tests, indicate a non-linear and asymmetric relationship with moderate diversification enhancing stability, whereas excessive diversification undermines it. These findings provide actionable insights for financial practitioners and policymakers, with significant implications for Islamic banking regulation and risk management strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal Inference; Financial Stability; Generalized Propensity Score Matching; Islamic Banks; Revenue Diversification","","","","The distinctive features of IBs, rooted in IME and Shariah principles, are twofold. First, IBs differentiate between investment accounts\u2014comparable to mutual fund shares with no guaranteed returns\u2014and demand deposits, which are fully guaranteed, and non-yielding and operate on a full-reserve basis rather than a fractional-reserve system (Ahmed, 2017; Khan, 1987). Second, IBs adhere strictly to Shariah principles, prohibiting interest (Riba), and excessive uncertainty (Gharar), and promoting risk-sharing. Ethical at their core, IBs invest depositors' funds in partnerships, sharing profits and losses. To support this model, IBs employ interest-free financing instruments based on Profit and Loss Sharing (PLS) and markup-based non-PLS financing (Hassan et al., 2003; Zaher and Kabir, 2001). These mechanisms bolster IBs' resilience, as losses on assets (e.g., Musharakah contracts) can be passed to investment account holders (e.g., Mudharabah arrangements), complementing the bank's book capital for added protection (Haddou and Mkhinini, 2023). In essence, by prohibiting injustice, fostering benevolence and embracing robust financial principles, Islamic banking offers a resilient and equitable alternative to conventional finance.As profitability indicators, we consider the accounting-based performance indicators, namely Return On Assets (ROA), the risk-adjusted Return On Average Assets (ROAA), which are computed as the risk-adjusted return on average assets (ROAA = ROA/SD(ROA)), and the cost-to-income ratio (EFF). It is worth stressing that by taking the ratio of ROA to SD(ROA), we obtain a metric that assesses how well a bank is performing relative to the risk. Hence, a higher ROA/SD(ROA) ratio indicates that the bank is achieving better returns relative to the amount of risk it is exposed to, which makes it a risk-adjusted performance indicator. The higher the value of ROA and ROAA, the more profitable the bank is (Mollah and Zaman, 2015; Trinh et al., 2020). Likewise, a higher cost-to-income ratio suggests lower bank cost efficiency (Abdelsalam et al., 2022). As risk indicators, we consider (i) credit risk as measured by the non-performance finance to total finance (NPF), (ii) default risk measured by Z-Score, and (iii) liquidity risk proxied by the deposits and short-term funding (LIQ). Higher values of Z-Score and LIQ imply lower risks, while higher values of NPF suggest higher bank risks. All these common risk indicators represent the overall financial stability of the banking sector (see, among others, Trinh et al., 2020; Elnahass et al., 2021).By and large, the conventional banking literature (see, among others, Ammar and Boughrara, 2019a; Mercieca et al., 2007) assumes that there are two main components of a bank's net operating income, namely the net financing income (NET) and the non-financing income (NON). The NET variable is calculated as the total financing revenues minus the total financing expenses, while NON is calculated as the sum of the net commission fees, net trading profit/loss and the other non-financing income. The sum of the NET and NON variables is the net operating income (net financing income plus non-financing income) of a bank. Bank income diversification means that a bank diversifies its sources of net operating income among the main two types of income, i.e. the net finance income and the non-financing income. When the values of the net financing income and the non-financing income are equal to each other, the bank is accepted as fully diversified (we assume that TOP=NOI). The DIVREV index evaluates each bank diversification between the major income sources, and it can be computed as follows:These outcomes demonstrate that whilst moderate diversification mitigates credit risk as measured by NPF, both underdiversification and overdiversification intensify it, thus supporting again the theoretical predictions outlined earlier. In light of these results, we conclude that hypothesis H1 is corroborated.Similarly, when we examine the same key parameter, \u03B12, for the risk indicators, we find that it is negative and statistically significant for measures of insolvency risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, and (columns 4, 5, and 6 in Table F1, Appendix F). These results reinforce the findings from the baseline GPS-DRF model. Furthermore, the coefficient \u03B12 is positive and statistically significant for the credit risk indicator, NPF (column 7, Table F1, Appendix F), providing further support for the findings from the GPS-DRF model. We also present the estimates of the parameters from Equation (8) for the specification that includes an alternative proxy for operational risk, namely SD(ROA). The results from this specification (column 8, Table F1, Appendix F) align closely with those obtained from the baseline GPS-DRF model (see Figure D7, Appendix D).The data used in this article are mainly sourced from the Islamic Financial Services Board database (IFSB, 2022). Some variables are extracted from International Monetary Fund (IMF) database and the World Bank database ( IMF, 2022; World Bank, 2022).

This raises the question of whether the financial performance of mixed-ownership firms (Mixed firms) is better than that of private-owned enterprises (POEs). Although Mixed firms suffer more from government intervention, unclear property rights, and interest conflicts between state and private shareholders, they can also benefit from the external resources controlled by the state. Therefore, the performance of Mixed firms is still unclear. Collecting data from the Chinese A-share listed market, we divide the firms into POEs, Mixed firms controlled by the state (MixedSOEs), and Mixed firms controlled by the private sectors (MixedPOEs). Measuring profitability using ROA and ROE, we find that POEs perform better than Mixed firms, and MixedPOEs have a higher profitability than MixedSOEs. Better corporate governance is the primary channel that can explain our results. We address the endogeneity challenge in several ways and get similar results.

The extant research has not fully explored the greenwashing issue concerning GBs, particularly due to the controversies in the methods for identifying such practices. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the global markets have seen a slowdown in the issuance of GBs, whereas China has experienced a surge in its GB market, emerging as the world's foremost issuer of GBs. In light of this economic reality and to address the research gap, this study draws on Chinese GBs as research objects and examines for the first time the issue of greenwashing in GBs through the lens of stock mispricing (SM). The results reveal that the issuance of GBs by companies significantly exacerbates SM, indicating the presence of greenwashing in Chinese GBs. Notably, the greenwashing issue is more pronounced when firms that issue GBs have political connections with the government and experience low financial risks.

To address cyclical fluctuations in the industry and uncertainties in the external environment, Chinese RE industry has sparked a wave of supply chain vertical integration. However, whether vertical integration strategies can effectively drive the sustainable development of the RE industry remains uncertain. To address this gap, we conducted a study focusing on Chinese RE firms from 2011 to 2022. Employing a two-way fixed effects model, our findings revealed several vital insights: (1) Vertical integration strategies contribute to reducing business risks for RE enterprises. Specifically, it enhances market power and supply chain efficiency, thereby lowering business risks. However, it also increases management costs, thereby elevating business risks for the enterprises. (2) RE subsidies, as an incentive-based environmental policy, and market competition amplify the effectiveness of vertical integration strategies in mitigating business risks. (3) Vertical integration has a significant impact on the business risks of enterprises with high managerial, innovative, and fundraising capabilities, but it has no significant effect on the business risks of those with low managerial, innovative, and fundraising capabilities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Policy; Market Competition; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development; Vertical Integration Strategies; Commerce; Energy Policy; Environmental Management; Environmental Remediation; Green Development; Integration; Renewable Energy; Supply Chains; Sustainable Development; Business Risks; Environmental Market; Environmental Policy; Integration Strategy; Market Competition; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Industries; Uncertainty; Vertical Integration; Vertical Integration Strategy; Competition; Alternative Energy; Environmental Management; Environmental Policy; Sustainable Development; Vertical Integration; Article; Commercial Phenomena; Competition; Controlled Study; Energy; Human; Market; Pharmaceutics; Renewable Energy; China; Environmental Protection; Industry; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Industry; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development","Commerce; Energy policy; Environmental management; Environmental remediation; Green development; Integration; Renewable energy; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Business risks; Environmental market; Environmental policy; Integration strategy; Market competition; Renewable energies; Renewable Energy industries; Uncertainty; Vertical integration; Vertical integration strategy; Competition; alternative energy; environmental management; environmental policy; sustainable development; vertical integration; article; commercial phenomena; competition; controlled study; energy; human; market; pharmaceutics; renewable energy; China; environmental protection; industry; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Industry; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Development","","","This paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program, No 72133003).","Andreou, Panayiotis C., The impact of vertical integration on inventory turnover and operating performance, International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications, 19, 3, pp. 218-238, (2016); Athari, Seyed Alireza, Global economic policy uncertainty and renewable energy demand: Does environmental policy stringency matter?

Given the increasing scrutiny on corporate sustainability, understanding this relationship is crucial to promote genuine environmental practices. Utilising a comprehensive dataset for non-financial S&P 1500 firms from 2007 through to 2018, we find that firms led by narcissistic CEOs are more likely to engage in greenwashing. We further find this relationship to be more pronounced when narcissistic CEOs increasingly engage in CSR initiatives, employ greater financial leverage and face more financial constraints. Our findings suggest that narcissistic traits in CEOs can undermine genuine corporate sustainability efforts, highlighting the need for stronger governance and transparency measures.

The findings reveal intricate risk transmission mechanisms among these three markets, with the new energy market identified as the primary source of risk, the environmental governance market serving as a hub for risk transmission, and the fossil energy market acting as the recipient of risk. The risk decomposition results indicate that continuous and jump risks coexist between the markets. Additionally, the risk spillover effects demonstrate significant asymmetry in both upward and downward directions. Higher-order moment risk analysis reveals structural imbalances and tail risk spillovers among the markets. Frequency domain analysis shows that risk spillovers exhibit significant long-term memory. Furthermore, dynamic analysis indicates that major events, such as the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the COVID-19 pandemic, have profoundly impacted market risk spillovers, exacerbating the suddenness, asymmetry, and tail risk characteristics of these risks. Moreover, the portfolio constructed based on minimum connectedness demonstrates excellent returns and validates the effectiveness of hedging strategies in the new energy and environmental governance markets.

Moreover, these firms need to strike a balance between conflicting but interconnected environmental and social practices. While existing literature highlights several firm and macro-level factors that may improve E&S integration, prioritizing the key firm-level enablers for optimal E&S performance remains a critical task for practising managers. This study aims to identify and prioritize the enablers of E&S integration, providing a strategic roadmap for firms operating in emerging markets. We identified 19 key E&S enablers from the extant literature and validated them through expert opinions. A three-level hierarchical framework was employed to synthesize expert opinions. A structured questionnaire gathered input from experts, and fuzzy-AHP analysis was used to quantify and prioritize the E&S enablers. Our findings reveal that at the local level, a firm's institutional structure takes precedence over financial characteristics. However, at the global level, three financial characteristic enablers rank among the top six. The top six E&S enablers are Leverage, Board independence, Board diversity, State ownership, Profitability, and Operating Risk. To validate the robustness of our results, we conducted a consistency check, sensitivity analysis, and comparative analysis using SWARA. These tests confirm the reliability of our findings, ensuring that there is logical coherence amongst the opinions, and rankings remain relatively stable despite adjustments. These findings have significant implications for diverse stakeholders. Investors, creditors, and lenders can mitigate E&S-related risks by including identified enablers in their investment management process. Regulatory bodies shall ensure board diversity and independence to promote long-term sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental And Social Integration; Financial Characteristics; Fuzzy-ahp; Institutional Structure; Sensitivity Analysis; Sensitivity Analysis; Emerging Market Firms; Environmental Integration; Environmental Practices; Expert Opinion; Financial Characteristic; Fuzzy Ahp; Institutional Structure; Sensitivity Analyzes; Social Integrations; Social Practices; Investments","Sensitivity analysis; Emerging market firms; Environmental integration; Environmental practices; Expert opinion; Financial characteristic; Fuzzy AHP; Institutional structure; Sensitivity analyzes; Social integrations; Social practices; Investments","","","","Abdul Rahman, Rashidah Binti, Determinants of Corporate Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Reporting among Asian Firms, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 14, 4, (2021); Al Amosh, Hamzeh, Ownership structure and environmental, social and governance performance disclosure: the moderating role of the board independence, Journal of Business and Socio-economic Development, 2, 1, pp. 49-66, (2022); Al Amosh, Hamzeh, Corporate governance and voluntary disclosure of sustainability performance: the case of Jordan, SN Business and Economics, 1, 12, (2021); undefined, (2023); undefined, (2021); Aouadi, Amal, Do ESG Controversies Matter for Firm Value?

Our empirical analysis reveals a positive correlation between customer concentration and greenwashing, driven by reduced corporate transparency and higher agency costs. This effect is stronger in non-state-owned firms, those facing intense market competition, and those in less polluting industries. By contrast, the relationship is weaker for firms with government or state-owned clients, which may demand greater environmental and social accountability. Additionally, firms with concentrated customers are more likely to engage in greenwashing under negative media pressure. However, this correlation weakens in the post-COVID-19 period. Moreover, pressure-sensitive institutional investors encourage such firms to engage in greenwashing, whereas pressure-resistant investors curb this behavior. Lastly, effective internal controls mitigate greenwashing associated with concentrated customers. This research enhances our understanding of factors driving corporate greenwashing behavior and underscores the importance of transparency and stakeholder pressure in curbing it. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Cost; Corporate Greenwashing; Customer Concentration; Firm Transparency; Government Customer","","","","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number: 72362021, and Grant Number: 72273041).","Afghahi, Mahla, Exploring the impact of customer concentration on stock price crash risk, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 11, 1, (2024); Ahsan, Tanveer, How to deal with customer and supplier concentration to attain sustainable financial growth?

Using firm-level data from A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2022, we examine how climate risk affects corporate debt financing capacity. We find that climate change risk significantly weakens firms’ ability to raise debt, leading to lower leverage and higher financing costs. These results remain robust across various checks for endogeneity and alternative specifications. We also show that reducing corporate carbon emission intensity can mitigate the negative impact of climate risk on debt financing, suggesting that supply-side credit policies are more effective than demand-side capital structure choices. Furthermore, we identify three channels through which climate risk impairs debt capacity: reduced competitiveness, increased default risk, and diminished resilience. Our heterogeneity analysis reveals that these adverse effects are more pronounced for non-state-owned firms, firms with weaker internal controls, and companies in highly financialized regions, and during periods of heightened environmental uncertainty. We also apply textual analysis and machine learning to the measurement of climate change risks, partially mitigating the geographic biases and single-dimensional shortcomings inherent in macro-level indicators, thus enriching the quantitative research on climate change risks. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and financial institutions in promoting corporate green transition, guiding capital allocation, and supporting sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Emissions; Climate Change Risk; Corporate Debt Financing Capacity; Carbon Emission; Climate Change; Financial Market; Machine Learning; Policy Making; Quantitative Analysis; Sustainable Development; China","carbon emission; climate change; financial market; machine learning; policy making; quantitative analysis; sustainable development; China","","","This research was funded by the 2024 Shandong Province Social Science Planning Research Project: Research on Pathways to Accelerate Comprehensive Green Transformation of Economic and Social Development in the Context of Further Deepening Reforms, grant number 24CXSXJ29, from Shandong Jinping Xi Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Research Center.","World Economic Forum, (2024); Climate Change in Asia and Africaexamining the Biophysical and Social Consequences and Societys Responses, (2025); Qi, Yu, Valuing high temperature's fiscal costs: Evidence from China, Economic Analysis and Policy, 81, pp. 134-152, (2024); Stat Decis, (2024); Stroebel, Johannes, What do you think about climate finance?, Journal of Financial Economics, 142, 2, pp. 487-498, (2021); Management World, (2024); Speech Given Lloyds of London 29 September 2015; Ssrn, (2019); Xi, Yue, Energy transition concern: Time-varying effect of climate policy uncertainty on renewables consumption, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 192, (2023); Baldauf, Markus, Does climate change affect real estate prices? only if you believe in it, Review of Financial Studies, 33, 3, pp. 1256-1295, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011848253"

The results show that more frequent visits in the previous year increase managers’ risk-taking decisions in later years and that firms experience lower earnings quality. Interestingly, the concentration of shareholding and management power, traditionally believed to be negative corporate governance instruments, alleviate such risk-taking if a firm is a state-owned enterprise (SOE). For non-SOEs, the more concentrated the shareholding and management power the further the risks increase. These results are attributed to the political connection of the manager, which would make managers more risk averse when under market focus and minimize risks that would damage their reputation and political career. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Controlled Study; High Risk Behavior; Human; Manager; Risk Seeking; China; Economics; Investment; Motivation; Humans; Investments; Motivation; Risk-taking","article; controlled study; high risk behavior; human; manager; risk seeking; China; economics; investment; motivation; Humans; Investments; Motivation; Risk-Taking","","","","Cheng, Agnes S.Agnes, Analyst forecasts: sales and profit margins, Review of Accounting Studies, 25, 1, pp. 54-83, (2020); Huang, Shawn X., Analyst Coverage and the Likelihood of Meeting or Beating Analyst Earnings Forecasts, Contemporary Accounting Research, 34, 2, pp. 871-899, (2017); Brown, Lawrence D., To beat or not to beat?

High-Custor firms outperform low-Custor firms by 1.5% per month during the financial crisis and by 4.7% per month during the COVID-19 crisis. This positive Custor-returns relation is robust to different treatments and persists after accounting for factors that contribute to corporate resilience, such as CSR activities. Our findings lend credence to the notion that customer orientation enhances a firm's social capital, leading to improved operational performance during adverse periods, whilst our empirical evidence further supports that Custor and CSR represent distinct pathways for building trust. Consequently, firms that prioritize customer orientation experience greater resilience to negative shocks, especially during periods of low market confidence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","10-k Filings; Corporate Resilience; Covid-19; Customer Orientation; Financial Crisis; Stock Returns; Textual Analysis; Trust","","","","","Aabo, Tom, CEO personality traits, strategic flexibility, and firm dynamics, Journal of Corporate Finance, 84, (2024); Acharya, Viral V., The risk of being a fallen angel and the corporate dash for cash in the midst of COVID, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, 9, 3, pp. 430-471, (2020); Ahmed, M.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 1,195 firm-year observations (international data set) from 2018 to 2022, which are divided into groups based on mandatory vs voluntary adoption of the international integrated reporting framework (IIRF) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Furthermore, regression analysis is used in the analyses. Findings: The findings revealed a significant and positive relationship between IRQ and value creation on a global scale. In addition, unlike voluntary adoption of the IIRF, mandatory adoption of it showed a significant and positive relationship between IRQ and value creation. Furthermore, an increase in the CDS had a greater impact on value creation compared to IRQ. Finally, in contrast to companies with voluntary adoption of both IIRF and SASB, companies with mandatory adoption of them exhibited a significant and positive relationship between these reports and value creation. Practical implications: The findings have practical implications for various stakeholders. First, by enhancing the awareness and understanding of integrated reporting and sustainability reporting among users, these results can facilitate more informed economic decision-making and enable a more accurate assessment of a company's potential for value creation. Second, these findings can contribute to the development of more effective and tailored reporting guidelines that align with the nuances of value creation dynamics in different contexts. Ultimately, this research can lead to improvements in reporting practices and regulatory frameworks, benefiting both companies and their stakeholders. Social implications: The study's social implications are significant as it offers insights into the global debate surrounding the adoption of the IIRF and the objectives of the merger involving the Value Reporting Foundation and the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation. The findings provide a concrete basis for evaluating the value of adopting the IIRF and inform discussions on the future of reporting standards and practices. Originality/value: Furthermore, it stands as one of the pioneering endeavors to investigate the value creation aspects of CDS. These unique aspects make a substantive contribution by expanding the frontiers of knowledge in the realm of corporate reporting and financial implications, offering novel insights and opportunities for further research in this crucial domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Integrated Reporting Quality; Mandatory Adoption; Sustainability Reporting Quality; Value Creation; Voluntary Adoption","","","","","International Journal of Scientific Technology Research, (2021); Adams, Renée B., Understanding the relationship between founder-CEOs and firm performance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 16, 1, pp. 136-150, (2009); Adegboyegun, A.

Our approach is based on the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and climate change considerations by investors. We use ESG scores as a part of the information set used by investors to determine the unconditional version of the conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Our results show that the ESG score allows the linearized version of the conditional CAPM to greatly outperform the classic CAPM and the Fama–French three-factor model for different sorts of stock portfolios, contributing significantly to reducing pricing errors. Furthermore, we find a negative price of risk for stocks that covary positively with ESG growth, which suggests that green assets may perform better than brown ones if ESG concerns suddenly become more pressing over time. Thus, our paper constitutes a step forward in the attempt to shed light on how climate change is priced regardless of the climate risk measure used. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Pricing; Climate Change; Conditioning Information; Esg; Sustainable Finance","","","","This work was supported by the Rey Juan Carlos University [grant number C1PREDOC2020/PREDOC20-017].","Abbassi, Wajih, What makes firms vulnerable to the Russia–Ukraine crisis?, Journal of Risk Finance, 24, 1, pp. 24-39, (2023); Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, Multifractality and cross-correlation between the crude oil and the European and non-European stock markets during the Russia-Ukraine war, Resources Policy, 80, (2023); Aharon, David Yechiam, Oil price shocks and inflation: A cross-national examination in the ASEAN5+3 countries, Resources Policy, 82, (2023); Albuquerque, Rui, Resiliency of environmental and social stocks: An analysis of the exogenous COVID-19 market crash, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, 9, 3, pp. 593-621, (2020); Climate Change Concerns and the Performance of Green Versus Brown Stocks, (2020); Asness, Clifford S., Value and Momentum Everywhere, Journal of Finance, 68, 3, pp. 929-985, (2013); Baker, Malcolm P., The Pricing and Ownership of US Green Bonds, Annual Review of Financial Economics, 14, pp. 415-437, (2022); Balvers, Ronald J., Temperature shocks and the cost of equity capital: Implications for climate change perceptions, Journal of Banking and Finance, 77, pp. 18-34, (2017); Climate Change Risk, (2019); Bebchuk, Lucian A., What matters in corporate governance, Review of Financial Studies, 22, 2, pp. 783-827, (2009)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277072","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009287139"

In light of these changes, the present study aims to provide a structural overview of the current state of research on the behaviour of retail investors. Based on a dataset of 386 articles sourced from the Web of Science database, this study employs a composite bibliometric approach of a co-word and co-citation analysis as well as a network analysis to determine preceding scientific discourses, current research themes, and potential avenues for future research. The co-word analysis identifies seven distinct research themes: (1) implications for financial performance; (2) information behaviour; (3) behavioural biases and investor characteristics; (4) investor attention; (5) attitudes towards financial risks; (6) socially responsible investing; and (7) complex financial retail instruments. Incorporating applicable research on individual investors, private investors, and household investors from referenced articles, the co-citation analysis reveals nine preceding scientific discourses. Additionally, the network analyses highlight the concepts and publications currently shaping and likely to influence future research in this field. The present study contributes to the academic discourse by mapping the intellectual landscape of retail investor behaviour, suggesting avenues for future research, and offering valuable insights for navigating this dynamic field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bibliometric Review; Co-word Analysis; Individual Investor Terminology; Investment Behaviour; Retail Investor","","","","","Abreu, Margarida, How biased is the behavior of the individual investor in warrants?, Research in International Business and Finance, 47, pp. 139-149, (2019); Abreu, Margarida, Information, overconfidence and trading: Do the sources of information matter?, Journal of Economic Psychology, 33, 4, pp. 868-881, (2012); Abreu, Margarida, The investor in structured retail products: Advice driven or gambling oriented?, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 17, pp. 1-9, (2018); Ahn, Yongkil, The anatomy of the disposition effect: Which factors are most important?, Finance Research Letters, 44, (2022); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Constructing A Tpb Questionnaire Conceptual and Methodological Considerations, (2002); Financial Services Review, (1998); AlQudah, Mohammad Zakaria, The Sustainability of Investing in Cryptocurrencies: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Trends, International Journal of Financial Studies, 11, 3, (2023); Al-Somali, Sabah Abdullah, An investigation into the acceptance of online banking in Saudi Arabia, Technovation, 29, 2, pp. 130-141, (2009); Andriosopoulos, Dimitris, The short-term impact of director trading in UK closed-end funds, European Journal of Finance, 21, 8, pp. 672-690, (2015)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277072","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008871066"

Drawing on data from listed energy-intensive manufacturing firms in China from 2015 to 2020, our findings reveal that: (1) ESG practices play a significant role in stimulating R&D investment, with green finance further reinforcing this effect. (2) Corporate R&D investment exerts a positive impact on both radical and incremental innovation. Additionally, regional human capital combined with R&D investment synergistically enhances the innovation output. (3) Both radical and incremental innovations contribute positively to corporate TFP.

We choose the setting of China, the world's second-largest economy that has recently experienced substantial growth in foreign portfolio investment and increased its commitment to CSR. We document that CSR performance significantly influences the portfolio allocation decisions of certain types of FIO. Crucially, our analysis reveals that firms with a higher level of ownership by foreign institutional investors are associated with a more positive relation between CSR performance and firm value. This finding is robust to endogeneity examinations, including quasi-natural experiments and instrumental variable estimations. The finding is stronger for non-state-owned enterprises, firms with higher customer awareness, firms with more foreign directors, and firms with more frequent corporate site visits from FIO. Monitoring and advising are two likely channels through which FIO enhance the CSR-value relation. Finally, we demonstrate that FIO enhance firms’ ability to harness the power of CSR as a driver of innovation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Environmental, Social, And Governance (esg); Firm Performance; Foreign Institutional Investors; Innovation","","","","\u2606 We thank Jeong Ho (John) Kim, Meziane Lasfer, Hongxia Wang, the seminar participants at Old Dominion University, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, the University of New Hampshire, and participants at the 2023 Eastern Finance Association Annual Meeting, the 2022 Southern Finance Association Annual Meeting, the 2022 Financial Markets and Corporate Governance conference, the 2022 Finance and Accounting Annual Research Symposium, and the 2022 Conference on the Role of Institutional Investors in International Corporate Governance: Contemporary Paradigms and Perspectives.","Acharya, Viral V., Banks' Financial Reporting and Financial System Stability, Journal of Accounting Research, 54, 2, pp. 277-340, (2016); Aggarwal, Reena, Does governance travel around the world?

Methodological choices are discussed, with attention to the limitations of excluding non-empirical and non-firm-level studies. The review also underscores the need for greater inclusion of participatory governance and community engagement practices to drive meaningful sustainability outcomes. Case studies and examples illustrate practical applications of these governance mechanisms in diverse settings. The review concludes by identifying critical research gaps. It offers recommendations for future studies, emphasising the need for longitudinal and mixed-method approaches to deepen understanding of governance’s role in sustainable development.

It has experienced significant growth over the past few years. To meet the customers' and stakeholders’ variety of service needs, sustainable development of the service organizations is essential. Sustainable development enables the organization to balance operational efficiency with the organizational market, economic, environmental, and social goals. However, the unpredictable and turbulent nature of service demand necessitates the adoption of a comprehensive framework. The integrated sustainable-green-lean-six sigma-agile service system (ISGLSASS) is a novel framework designed to integrate sustainability, environmental consciousness, operational efficiency, quality improvement, and agility. This study aims to identify the drivers influencing the adoption of ISGLSASS through a systematic literature review. Twelve key drivers have been identified, including government regulations (current and future), incentives, peer and public pressure, cost benefits, competition, customer demand, supply chain pressures, top management commitment, technological advancements, resource availability, and organizational image. These drivers collectively facilitate the implementation of ISGLSASS in service organizations, enhancing their sustainability and adaptability in volatile markets. The novelty of this research lies in several aspects: (i) it is the first study to propose the ISGLSASS concept for service organizations, (ii) it integrates the social, economic, environmental, and market dimensions, (iii) it identifies the drivers associated with ISGLSASS, (iv) it enhances organizational sustainability in the turbulent market, (v) it addresses the need for customized and sustainable services, and (vi) it introduces the concept of service organization symbiosis, where mutual benefits are achieved through expertise, assistance, and support for stakeholders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Integrated Sustainable-green-lean-six Sigma-agile Service System (isglsass); Isglsa Service Business Model; Isglsa Service Organizations; Isglsa Services; Literature Review","","","","","Abbas, Jaffar, The impact of knowledge sharing and innovation on sustainable performance in Islamic banks: A mediation analysis through a SEM approach, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 15, (2019); Abbasi, Maisam, Developing environmentally sustainable logistics.

In finance, AI automates complex tasks like risk assessment, fraud detection, and predictive analytics, allowing firms to make more informed decisions and manage risk with precision. In auditing, AI tools enhance the ability to analyze large amounts of financial data, identifying discrepancies that may have gone unnoticed, improving transparency and accountability. Investment strategies are reshaped as AI-powered algorithms optimize portfolio management, forecast market trends, and execute trades in real time, reducing human error and enabling faster decision-making. While these advancements offer incredible benefits, they also raise concerns about security, data privacy, and the potential for job displacement in traditional financial roles, which requires further exploration.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample comprising 520 firm-year observations from Indian listed firms for the period from 2017 to 2021, the current study estimates WCM efficiency using the Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) input-oriented model of data envelopment analysis (DEA). In addition, this study performs baseline, robustness and heterogeneity tests to examine the effect of ESG performance and its components on WCM efficiency. Findings: Our findings show that firms with high ESG performance better manage short-term liquidity. Also, environmental performance (EP), social performance (SP) and governance performance (GP) highlight a similar positive association with WCM efficiency. As per the heterogeneity test results, both high- and low-sustainable firms showcase the necessity of ESG performance to achieve efficiency in managing their working capital. Practical implications: The findings emphasize the need for managers and policymakers to integrate sustainable practices with financial strategies, enhancing both short-term stability and long-term sustainability goals and thereby guiding effective policy and governance enhancements. Originality/value: We attempt to adjudicate the role of sustainability on WCM efficiency from an emerging country perspective, which has not yet been explored.

Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 89 companies listed in the SBF 120 during the period 2012–2018 has been employed. The authors have obtained the explanatory variables using the principal component analysis method. To provide empirical evidence for the testable hypotheses, the authors have estimated a least squares regression. A differences-in-differences analysis has been estimated to analyze the impact of the gender quota law imposition. Findings: The regression results indicate that companies with a higher proportion of ACFEMALE have more tendency to use REM rather than AEM. The authors further denote that the ACFEMALE expertise negatively affects AEM. Moreover, the authors find that the ACFEMALE experience helps reduce both AEM and REM. Results from the DID analysis exhibit that the ACFEMALE effect on the trade-off between REM and AEM occurs for the period that follows the implementation of the French gender quota law. Furthermore, the authors denote that the negative link between the ACFEMALE experience and AEM and REM dissipates for both the pre- and the postgender quota law adoption. Originality/value: This study extends the prior existing research by examining, for the first time, the relationship between female directors’ appointments and the trade-off between accrual-based and REM. As well as, the research provides primary evidence on the channels through which female directors may affect the managerial preference regarding the earnings management techniques AEM or REM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accrual-based Earnings Management; Audit Committee; Experience; Expertise; Female; Real Earnings Management","","","","","Abdelfattah, Tarek, Female Audit Partners and Extended Audit Reporting: UK Evidence, Journal of Business Ethics, 174, 1, pp. 177-197, (2021); Al Lawati, Hidaya, Disclosure quality vis-à-vis disclosure quantity: Does audit committee matter in Omani financial institutions?, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 57, 2, pp. 557-594, (2021); Alhababsah, Salem, Audit committee and audit quality: An empirical analysis considering industry expertise, legal expertise and gender diversity, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 42, (2021); Alkebsee, Radwan Hussien, Audit committee independence and financial expertise and earnings management: evidence from China, International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics, 16, 2, pp. 176-194, (2022); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Arun, Thankom G., Female directors and earnings management: Evidence from UK companies, International Review of Financial Analysis, 39, pp. 137-146, (2015); Bédard, Jean Luc, The effect of audit committee expertise, independence, and activity on aggressive earnings management, Auditing, 23, 2, pp. 13-35, (2004); Ben-Amar, Walid, What Makes Better Boards?

While most firms have been receptive to these pressures, they have also been observed to devise strategies to circumvent regulatory guidelines and avoid liabilities. Drawing on a sustainable finance dataset on cross-border listed firms, this article examines how geographical distance in cross-border listings may exacerbate the amount of Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions that firms produce to varying degrees. The findings across different model specifications reveal that distance is associated with increases in emissions among cross-listed firms, but the effect of distance is stronger for ln Scope 1 and ln Scope 2 Emissions among non-primary listings, whereas the effect is stronger for ln Scope 3 Emissions among primary listings. This article offers evidence that geographical distance in cross-border listings is a form of jurisdictional arbitrage used by firms to circumvent emissions regulations. Consistent with the way that firms offshore profits and operations to avoid tax liabilities, firms are theorized to offshore emissions and avoid emissions liabilities by listing in cross-border jurisdictions that are geographically distant from their home jurisdictions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Emissions; Cross-border Listed Firms; Distance; Sustainability","","","","Funding: This research was funded by a Departmental Start-up Grant and Applied Social Sciences Research Grant from the Department of Applied Social Sciences at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Firstly, the approach employs a stock-picking procedure based on an interactive multi-criteria decision-making method (the so-called TODIM method). More precisely, the best-performing assets from the investable universe are identified using three financial criteria. The first criterion is based on mutual information, and it is employed to capture the microstructure of the stock market. The second one is the momentum, and the third is the upside-to-downside beta ratio. To calculate the preference weights used in the chosen multi-criteria decision-making procedure, two methods are compared, namely equal and entropy weighting. In the second stage, this work considers a portfolio optimization model where the objective function is a modified version of the Sharpe ratio, consistent with the choices of a rational agent even when faced with negative risk premiums. Additionally, the portfolio design incorporates a set of bound, budget, and cardinality constraints, together with a set of risk budgeting restrictions. To solve the resulting non-smooth programming problem with non-convex constraints, this paper proposes a variant of the distance-based parameter adaptation for success-history-based differential evolution with double crossover (DISH-XX) algorithm equipped with a hybrid constraint-handling approach. Numerical experiments on the US and European stock markets over the past ten years are conducted, and the results show that the flexibility of the proposed portfolio model allows the better control of losses, particularly during market downturns, thereby providing superior or at least comparable ex post performance with respect to several benchmark investment strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dish-xx; Knowledge-based Financial Management System; Mutual Information; Portfolio Optimization; Risk Budgeting","","","","","Morel, Christophe, Stock selection using a multi-factor model - Empirical evidence from the French stock market, European Journal of Finance, 7, 4, pp. 312-334, (2001); de Franco, Carmine, Stock picking in the US market and the effect of passive investments, Journal of Asset Management, 22, 1, (2021); Breitung, Christian, Automated stock picking using random forests, Journal of Empirical Finance, 72, pp. 532-556, (2023); Wolff, Dominik, Stock picking with machine learning, Journal of Forecasting, 43, 1, pp. 81-102, (2024); Albadvi, A., Decision making in stock trading: An application of PROMETHEE, European Journal of Operational Research, 177, 2, pp. 673-683, (2006); Vetschera, Rudolf, A PROMETHEE-based approach to portfolio selection problems, Computers and Operations Research, 39, 5, pp. 1010-1020, (2012); Tavana, Madjid, A fuzzy hybrid project portfolio selection method using Data Envelopment Analysis, TOPSIS and Integer Programming, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 22, pp. 8432-8444, (2015); Vásquez, Jaime Alberto, AHP–TOPSIS methodology for stock portfolio investments, Risks, 10, 1, (2022); Ho, Wen Rong Jerry, Combined DEMATEL technique with a novel MCDM model for exploring portfolio selection based on CAPM, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 1, pp. 16-25, (2011); Pätäri, Eero J., Comparison of the multicriteria decision-making methods for equity portfolio selection: The U.S. evidence, European Journal of Operational Research, 265, 2, pp. 655-672, (2018)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","10994300","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006613091"

However, the perspective of modern behavioral finance is more concerned with the emotional and psychological factors associated with an investor. This research aims to identify the multi-mediating mechanism of risk perception and dividend policy in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The cross-sectional quantitative design was used, and the data was collected from 256 individuals for further analysis. The structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to assess the multi-mediation mechanism. The statistical results confirm that there is a significant positive impact of herding behavior and disposition effect on investment decisions. Moreover, this direct relationship is further assessed by inducting risk perception and dividend policy as mediators. The multi-mediation was proved by observing the specific effects. The results confirmed that individuals with an outcome of investment decision intend to behave more positively. Hence, individual investors having herding behavior and disposition effect produce an emphasizing effect on investment decision because it is mitigated with the simultaneous mediating effects of risk perception and dividend policy. The findings imply that investors should be aware of their behavioral factors and policymakers have to make their strategy accordingly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disposition Effect; Dividend Policy; Herding Behavior; Investment Decisions; Mediation; Risk Perception; Sem; Adult; Cross-sectional Study; Decision Making; Female; Human; Investment; Male; Mediation Analysis; Pakistan; Young Adult; Adult; Cross-sectional Studies; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Investments; Male; Mediation Analysis; Young Adult","adult; cross-sectional study; decision making; female; human; investment; male; mediation analysis; Pakistan; young adult; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Investments; Male; Mediation Analysis; Young Adult","","","","Ababio, Kofi Agyarko, Behavioural Portfolio Selection and Optimisation: Equities versus Cryptocurrencies, Journal of African Business, 21, 2, pp. 145-168, (2020); Abdin, Syed Zain Ul, The impact of heuristics on investment decision and performance: Exploring multiple mediation mechanisms, Research in International Business and Finance, 42, pp. 674-688, (2017); Adil, Mohd, How financial literacy moderate the association between behaviour biases and investment decision?, Asian Journal of Accounting Research, 7, 1, pp. 17-30, (2022); Ahmed, Sarwar Uddin, Do socio-political factors affect investment performance?, Cogent Economics and Finance, 10, 1, (2022); Ali, Heba Ahmed Abass, Corporate dividend policy in the time of COVID-19: Evidence from the G-12 countries, Finance Research Letters, 46, (2022); Ali, Searat, Corporate governance and the insolvency risk of financial institutions, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 55, (2021); Aljifri, Ruqayya, Investor psychology in the stock market: An empirical study of the impact of overconfidence on firm valuation, Borsa Istanbul Review, 23, 1, pp. 93-112, (2023); International Journal of Management Studies, (2017); Alves, Sandra, CEO duality, earnings quality and board independence, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 21, 2, pp. 217-231, (2023); Areıqat, Ahmad Yousef M., Impact of behavioral finance on stock investment decisions applied study on a sample of investors at Amman Stock Exchange, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, 23, 2, (2019)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00016918; 18736297","","APSOA","40174351","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001328480"

This paper divides tone into normal tone and abnormal tone and examines their influences on the risk-taking of banks’ assets and liabilities, respectively. By collecting 326 samples of 38 Chinese A-share listed banks’ annual reports during 2000–2020, the study finds that a more positive normal tone in annual reports indicates an increase in bank risk-taking behavior in the future. The competitive pressure and the policy shock plays a negative moderating role whereas the profitability has a positive moderating impact. Besides, the impact of the positive tone on increasing bank's risk-taking behavior is more prominent for state-owned banks than that of non-state-owned banks. However, the abnormal tone can not predict the bank's future risk-taking behavior. Finally, our findings show that the normal tone can provide forward-looking valuable information and has a significant predictive ability for a bank's future risk-taking behavior and its insolvency risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annual Reports; Bank Risk; Management Tone; Risk-taking; Textual Analysis","","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC Grant Numbers: 72371258, 72271253, 72001223, 72331010, 71850008), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Abbas, Faisal, How Do Capital Ratios Affect Bank Risk-Taking: New Evidence From the United States, SAGE Open, 11, 1, (2021); Abou-El-Sood, Heba S., Board gender diversity, power, and bank risk taking, International Review of Financial Analysis, 75, (2021); Acharya, Viral V., Banks' Financial Reporting and Financial System Stability, Journal of Accounting Research, 54, 2, pp. 277-340, (2016); Adrian, Tobias, Financial intermediaries and monetary economics, Handbook of Monetary Economics, 3, C, pp. 601-650, (2010); Akins, Brian K., Bank Competition and Financial Stability: Evidence from the Financial Crisis, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 51, 1, pp. 1-28, (2016); Allee, Kristian D., the structure of voluntary disclosure narratives: Evidence from tone dispersion, Journal of Accounting Research, 53, 2, pp. 241-274, (2015); Baginski, Stephen P., Linguistic tone and the small trader, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 68-69, pp. 21-37, (2018); Ballester, Laura, The role of internal corporate governance mechanisms on default risk: A systematic review for different institutional settings, Research in International Business and Finance, 54, (2020); Barry, Thierno Amadou, Ownership structure and risk in publicly held and privately owned banks, Journal of Banking and Finance, 35, 5, pp. 1327-1340, (2011); Bank Concentration and Crises, (2003)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","02755319","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001029262"

Due to factors such as information asymmetry and inadequate regulation, financial fraud severely restricts stakeholders' capital allocation behavior and hinders the sustainable development of the capital market. However, existing research lacks systematic and quantitative insights into the characteristics of firms involved in financial fraud, making it difficult to achieve quantitative identification of most such firms. This limitation arises from a predominant focus on the causal relationships between various financial indicators and financial fraud. In this paper, we integrate machine learning and enterprise portrait methods, using listed companies in the Chinese capital market as research subjects to predict corporate financial fraud. Firstly, a comprehensive system of indicators is established, covering seven dimensions: basic corporate information, profitability, solvency, operating efficiency, capital structure, corporate governance, and emotional attitude. Subsequently, the feature visualization portrait is created using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering and label classification, while the predictive role of multidimensional enterprise portrait features in assessing the risk of corporate financial fraud is examined. The results indicate that unstructured indicators, such as Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), can significantly enhance predictive capability for corporate financial fraud. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is introduced to reveal the influencing factors and characteristics of financial fraud. The empirical findings show that firms involved in financial fraud typically exhibit characteristics such as shorter listing times, weaker solvency and operating efficiency, higher capital structure, and poor corporate governance ability. Moreover, the XGBoost model demonstrates superior predictive performance among various models. The findings of this study provide a new perspective for in-depth exploration of the impact mechanisms of financial fraud and related regulatory warnings. These findings contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of governance and the capital allocation function within the capital market. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Enterprise Portrait; Financial Fraud; Interpretability Analysis; Machine Learning; Unstructured Data","","","","This work is supported by the Project of Graduate Student Science and Technology Innovation of Capital University of Economics and Business (grant number 2024KJCX050).","Al-Hashedi, Khaled Gubran, Financial fraud detection applying data mining techniques: A comprehensive review from 2009 to 2019, Computer Science Review, 40, (2021); Ali, Amal Al, A Powerful Predicting Model for Financial Statement Fraud Based on Optimized XGBoost Ensemble Learning Technique, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 4, (2023); Ali, Wajid, Causality mining in natural languages using machine and deep learning techniques: A survey, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 21, (2021); Amiram, Dan, Financial reporting fraud and other forms of misconduct: a multidisciplinary review of the literature, Review of Accounting Studies, 23, 2, pp. 732-783, (2018); Ampomah, Ernest Kwame, Stock market prediction with gaussian naïve bayes machine learning algorithm, Informatica (Slovenia), 45, 2, pp. 243-256, (2021); Behavioral Research in Accounting, (2001); Aris, Nooraslinda Abdul, Fraudulent financial statement detection using statistical techniques: The case of small medium automotive enterprise, Journal of Applied Business Research, 31, 4, pp. 1469-1478, (2015); Bai, Belinna, False financial statements: Characteristics of China's listed companies and cart detecting approach, International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, 7, 2, pp. 339-359, (2008); Beasley, Mark S., An empirical analysis of the relation between the board of director composition and financial statement fraud, Accounting Review, 71, 4, pp. 443-465, (1996); Bell, Timothy B., A decision aid for assessing the likelihood of fraudulent financial reporting, Auditing, 19, 1, pp. 168-184, (2000)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","0927538X","","PBFJE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214336765"

However, the evidence of the participation of women in the processes of internationalization of companies is not conclusive or adequate for emerging economies, such as those in Latin America. Based on this premise, we conducted this research using data from 1,246 firms included in the Fifth Longitudinal Survey of Chilean Companies. These companies are categorized into four industries: 98 in extractive, 149 in manufacturing, 285 in Commercial, and 714 in services. A Tobit regression model to estimate the influence of the presence of women in senior management and gender diversity on boards on the export intensity of the company. The main findings show that women in the position of CEO and a higher percentage of women on boards of directors do not affect the export intensity of the company. They also show that the relationship between foreign ownership and export intensity was positive and, finally, that export intensity did not depend on gender diversity in high-level administrative positions. An important limitation of this research is not having a data panel for each company to estimate their evolution over time thus, as well as information related to compensation contracts for management teams.

The data were collected during the years 2022/23 from 370 experts in finance, accounting, and auditing of businesses in Kosovo, while their processing was done through exploratory factorial analysis (EFA), confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA), and modeling of structural equations (SEM) using SPSS and AMOS programs. The results indicate that there are symbiotic relationships through direct and indirect effects on the factors, therefore digitalization has a positive effect on finance, accounting, and reporting. Specifically, the digitalization of expenses and cost planning (DECP) has a direct effect on the digitalization of transactions, financial reporting, and monitoring (DTFRM). This effect contributes to improvement, transparency, and decision making (DITDM). However, the DTFRM factor does not have a direct effect on the DITDM factor but has a mediated effect on the effect of DECP on DITDM. This means that in order to enhance improvement, transparency, and decision making (DITDM), the digitalization of expenses and cost planning (DECP) should also include financial transactions, financial reporting, and control processes (DTFRM). Therefore, the study highlights that digitalization plays a significant role in improving financial, accounting, and auditing processes as a strategic move to enhance their financial management capabilities, transparency, decision making, and control. For future studies, it is emphasized to conduct in depth research and analysis to better understand the complex relationship between DTFRM and DITDM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Digitalization; Finance; Reporting; Symbiotic Relationships","","","","","Afuah, Allan N., Redefining firm boundaries in the face of the internet: Are firms really shrinking?, Academy of Management Review, 28, 1, pp. 34-53, (2003); Agyenim-Boateng, Cletus, The role of structure in manipulating PPP accountability, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 30, 1, pp. 119-144, (2017); Allain, Élodie, Explaining implementation difficulties associated with activity-based costing through system uses, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 19, 1, pp. 181-198, (2018); Amonoo Nkrumah, Beatrice, Stakeholder accountability in the era of big data: an exploratory study of online platform companies, Qualitative Research in Accounting and Management, 20, 4, pp. 447-484, (2023); Azam, Md Shah, Diffusion of ICT and SME performance, Advances in Business Marketing and Purchasing, 23A, pp. 7-290, (2015); Bai, Chunguang, COVID-19 pandemic digitization lessons for sustainable development of micro-and small- enterprises, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 27, pp. 1989-2001, (2021); Ben Bouheni, Faten, An econometric understanding of Fintech and operating performance, Review of Accounting and Finance, 22, 3, pp. 329-352, (2023); Bi, Gongbing, The impact of information transparency on trade credit: the mediation role of risk, Kybernetes, 53, 1, pp. 27-57, (2024); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2016); Bilal, Bilal, Do the educational profile, gender, and professional experience of audit committee financial experts improve financial reporting quality?, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 53, (2023)","","Sciendo","","","","","","18424120; 23445416","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005635057"

It also seeks to investigate the impact of corporate governance mechanisms (CG) and the characteristics of board directors (BC) on CF. The study examined 480 annual reports from industrial and service firms listed on the Palestine and Jordan Stock Exchange markets, totaling 7,200 inputs. The research utilized a survival approach and the Cox hazard regression model. The study found a significant negative association between board size, board independence, board education, board age, firm size, and liquidity, considered together, and CF. Conversely, there is a significant positive association between profitability and CF. The log-likelihood test results indicated that the CG and BC models are significant. To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first in Palestine and Jordan to focus on the statistical prediction of financial failure, bridging a gap in the existing literature by understanding the association between governance indicators and board features on one hand, and financial failure on the other. Additionally, this study distinguishes itself as one of the pioneering studies within the accounting domain to adopt a survival approach, traditionally prevalent in medical research.

Against the backdrop of heightened attention to corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, whether ESG can serve as a mechanism to mediate the conflict between motives for holding cash necessitates further exploration. This paper focuses on the relationship between ESG performance and corporate cash reserves, uncovering a negative association between them. This conclusion persists across a series of robustness checks. Other tests indicate that ESG reduces corporate cash holdings by decreasing information asymmetry, default risk, and agency motives, affirming ESG’s positive role in alleviating conflicts in cash holding motives. Our heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative correlation between ESG and corporate cash holdings is more pronounced in private companies, non-highly polluting companies, and companies with lower degrees of capital market liberalization. Furthermore, the economic consequences demonstrate that the cash savings brought about by ESG performance significantly propel corporate growth. Our research offers beneficial insights for companies in emerging nations to alleviate the pressure of cash holdings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Motives; Corporate Cash Holdings; Default Risk; Esg; Information Asymmetry; Accountability; Capital Flow; Capital Market; Finance; Firm Size; Governance Approach; Liberalization; China","accountability; capital flow; capital market; finance; firm size; governance approach; liberalization; China","","","","Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Albuquerque, Rui, Corporate social responsibility and firm risk: Theory and empirical evidence, Management Science, 65, 10, pp. 4451-4469, (2019); Almeida, Heitor V., Corporate liquidity management: A conceptual framework and survey, Annual Review of Financial Economics, 6, pp. 135-162, (2014); Amihud, Yakov, Illiquidity and stock returns: Cross-section and time-series effects, Journal of Financial Markets, 5, 1, pp. 31-56, (2002); Ang, James S., Agency costs and ownership structure, Journal of Finance, 55, 1, pp. 81-106, (2000); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, CSR Performance and the Value of Cash Holdings: International Evidence, Journal of Business Ethics, 140, 2, pp. 263-284, (2017); Atif, Muhammad, Environmental, social and governance disclosure and default risk, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 8, pp. 3937-3959, (2021); Atif, Muhammad, Does board gender diversity affect corporate cash holdings?, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 46, 7-8, pp. 1003-1029, (2019); Atif, Muhammad, The effect of corporate environmental, social and governance disclosure on cash holdings: Life-cycle perspective, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 5, pp. 2193-2212, (2022); Bai, Xiong, ESG performance, institutional investors’ preference and financing constraints: Empirical evidence from China, Borsa Istanbul Review, 22, pp. S157-S168, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14358921; 03777332","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003769279"

In recent years, the advertising industry has been going through an unprecedented shift away from traditional and towards an increased reliance on digital advertising formats. As firms navigate this changing landscape, an underlying trend in corporate America is the increasing presence of Generation X directors on corporate boards. This study investigates the intersection of the two phenomena and finds that firms with a higher percentage of Generation X directors exhibit a more positive relation between advertising spending and firm performance, as well as faster adjustment to the optimal mix of traditional and digital forms of advertising.

The research addresses a critical question—whether digitalization reinforces or weakens the stabilizing effects of competition—in a region characterized by early-stage digital adoption and concentrated markets. Given the growing reliance on technology in banking, understanding its role in shaping risk dynamics is both scientifically relevant and practically important for policymakers and financial institutions. The study employs dynamic panel data analysis using the two-step GMM estimator. Bank stability is measured using the z-score, Competition is assessed through the Panzar-Rosse Model, and digitalization is captured via a composite index. The results reveal that bank competition improves stability, while digitalization alone initially increases risk due to operational vulnerabilities. However, the interaction between competition and digitalization has a positive and stabilizing effect, enhancing risk management and efficiency. These findings highlight the transformational role of digitalization, emphasizing the need for balanced competition policies and support for digital adoption to ensure financial stability in emerging markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Competition; Central Asia; Digitalization; Stability","","","","","International Monetary Fund Special Series on Covid 19 Transactions, (2020); Akande, O.

Drawing on the difference-in-differences (DID) method, this paper finds that depoliticization leads to an improvement in corporate ESG performance. Moreover, this paper examines the underlying mechanisms focusing on the prerequisite and motivations. Specifically, depoliticization reduces firms' rent-seeking expenditures, allowing resources to be allocated toward improving ESG performance and disclosing ESG information; to compensate for the negative influence of depoliticization, firms are motivated to improve ESG performance because ESG practice can enhance firms' competitiveness and financial performance. Further analyses show that the positive impact of depoliticization on ESG performance is more pronounced in eastern China and areas with lower levels of environmental regulation.

A transparent screening criterion based on publicly available information is desirable to help firms know what investors seek from their business activities. Screening criteria developed for Muslim investors serve this purpose; however, adherence to any such screening criteria requires significant business transformation and may affect the fundamental and market performance of firms. To empirically investigate this hypothesis, this paper examines the changes in screening criteria introduced by the Malaysian Financial Services Act 2013 as a case study. The empirical findings suggest that firms that switch between compliance and non-compliance not only underperform but also experience volatility and loss of shareholder value as compared with those firms that remained Shari'ah-compliant throughout the sample period. This suggests that being Shari'ah-compliant is not simply meeting some objective criteria. It is more about developing a business culture that is long-term oriented as being in and out of Shari'ah compliance in the short term does not serve the purpose of shareholder value maximization. The findings of this paper are important for regulators, firm managers, and investors' confidence in the screening process when transparent, rules-based screening criteria are in place. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Islamic Equity Investment; Islamic Finance; Moral And Ethical Investor Dilemma; Rules-based Screening Criteria; Sharia'ah Compliance; Socially Responsible Investing","","","","","Almansour, Abdullah Mohammed, Muslim investors and the capital market: The role of religious scholars, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 58, (2019); Alnamlah, Abdulaziz Abdualrahman S., A new model for screening Shariah-compliant firms, Borsa Istanbul Review, 22, pp. S10-S23, (2022); Anwer, Zaheer, Dividend payout policy of Shariah compliant firms: Evidence from United States, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 69, (2021); Anwer, Zaheer, Shariah screening and corporate governance: The case of constituent stocks of Dow Jones US Indices, International Review of Economics and Finance, 86, pp. 976-1002, (2023); Ashraf, Dawood, Does Shari’ah Screening Cause Abnormal Returns?

We capture downturns using three different crises that have significantly impacted the banking context, i.e., the Global Financial Crisis, the Sovereign Debt Crisis, and the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on a sample of 1,430 United States and European Union banks, we find that banks with negative pre-managed earnings recognize higher loan loss provisions to adjust downward earnings during downturns. Further tests show that such higher provisions are not significantly associated with future net charge-offs, whereas they are positively associated with future returns on assets. Collectively, empirical evidence suggests that banks with negative pre-managed earnings recognize higher than necessary losses during downturns to report better future performance. This study contributes to previous literature on earnings management by banks and offers insightful practical implications to regulators, policymakers, and investors, who are interested in evaluating the quality of financial reporting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank; Covid-19 Pandemic; Earnings Management; Global Financial Crisis; Loan Loss Provisions; Sovereign Debt Crisis","","","","We are very grateful for valuable comments from the two anonymous reviewers.

Discussion on the potential transmission channels demonstrates that such a positive association between digital executives and corporate ESG performance is mediated by the digital transformation and innovation capability of firms. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive nexus between executives with digital backgrounds and corporate ESG performance is more pronounced in firms receiving greater public attention, offering higher executive remuneration, and operating as technology-intensive or non-state-owned enterprises.

Drawing on human capital theory, upper echelon view, and imprint theory related to career embeddedness, we theorize that CEO career embeddedness is positively correlated with strategic decision-making (green innovation). We also analyze the moderating role of internal governance mechanisms (women CEO duality and gender diversity). Our empirical outcomes indicate that the positive relationship between CEO career embeddedness and green innovation is stronger when females have dual roles (CEO and chair) but weaker when there is a female is on board. These results suggest that female's dual role (CEO and chair) makes them more powerful and gives them freedom and dominance in decision-making. On the contrary, the positive association between CEO career embeddedness and green innovation is weaker because females are risk-averse and conservative, and they reduce the CEO's propensity for quality strategic decisions when they are on board.

Leveraging daily price data, the analysis focuses on major equity indices from Bangladesh, the USA, China, Japan, Russia, and India, in addition to global green and commodity indices. The study employs advanced methodologies, including value at risk (VaR), conditional value at risk (CVaR), continuous wavelet transforms (CWT), wavelet coherence (WC), and time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR). The findings reveal that while the DSE demonstrates lower downside risk relative to global indices, certain global assets, such as WTICO, exhibit heightened tail risk. The wavelet analyses underscore significant volatility and co-movements among key assets, particularly during periods of global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict, highlighting the profound interconnectedness between global and regional markets and the DSE. Notably, global green and commodity assets provide potential safe haven benefits for Bangladeshi investors during times of crisis. The TVP-VAR model further highlights the dynamic nature of volatility spillovers, identifying global green indices as key volatility transmitters, while the DSE retains robust internal market dynamics with reciprocal spillovers between DSE30 and DSEB. These insights suggest that Bangladesh should strategically integrate green and commodity assets into its financial markets to bolster market stability and protect investors amidst global uncertainties. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodity Indices; Dhaka Stock Exchange; Global Financial Markets; Green Assets; Strategic Integration; Trade Partners; Tvp-var; Volatility Spillovers; Wavelet Analysis","","","","","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Analyzing the static and dynamic dependence among green investments, carbon markets, financial markets and commodity markets, International Journal of Managerial Finance, 21, 1, pp. 286-327, (2025); Making of Contemporary Maldives Isolation Dictatorship and Democracy, (2022); Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, How COVID-19 drives connectedness among commodity and financial markets: Evidence from TVP-VAR and causality-in-quantiles techniques, Resources Policy, 70, (2021); Aftab, Muhammad, Economic integration and the currency and equity markets nexus, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 4, pp. 5278-5301, (2021); Co Integration of Bangladesh Stock Market with India Emerging and World Stock Market Indices, (2016); D Ahmed, Abdullahi Dahir, Financial integration, capital market development and economic performance: Empirical evidence from Botswana, Economic Modelling, 42, pp. 1-14, (2014); Akhtaruzzaman, Md, Financial contagion during COVID–19 crisis, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Albuquerque, Rui, Trade credit and cross-country predictable firm returns, Journal of Financial Economics, 115, 3, pp. 592-613, (2015); Allégret, Jean Pierre, Financial liberalization and stability of the financial system in emerging markets: The institutional dimension of financial crises, Review of International Political Economy, 10, 1, pp. 73-92, (2003); Al-Nassar, Nassar S., In search of hedges and safe havens during the COVID─19 pandemic: Gold versus Bitcoin, oil, and oil uncertainty, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 90, pp. 318-332, (2023)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","10964762","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209790921"

The categorical returns are classified into good returns (GRs), bad returns (BRs) and no returns (NRs). Therefore, the present study needs to use a one-hot-encoding function to convert a categorical dataset into a numeric format with TensorFlow.

The findings showed that currency exchange rate return 2 (CERR2) is relatively a safe-haven currency than currency exchange rate return 1 (CERR1) and currency exchange rate return 3 (CERR3).

The Taiwanese food industry has encountered some difficulties in internationalization, including insufficient production capacity, high tariffs, the lack of long-term planning by the government, and inadequate support from internal organizations. Overall, it is relatively problematic for the food industry to achieve internationalization, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is the trend of sustainable development for enterprises to fulfill. This paper empirically explores the joint impact of the degree of internationalization and ESG ratings on the financial performance of the Taiwanese food industry from 2015 to 2021. Our empirical results found that international diversification and ESG performance have joint positive and significant effects on the return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and return on sales (ROS) of the food industry, respectively. This means that the higher the internationalization of overseas companies in the food industry, the better the ESG performance would significantly improve its financial performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esg Rating; Financial Performance; Firm’s Internationalization; Firm’s Profitability; Food Industry; Business; Food Industry; Globalization; Governance Approach; Industrial Performance; Industrial Production; Performance Assessment; Profitability; Sustainable Development; Taiwan","business; food industry; globalization; governance approach; industrial performance; industrial production; performance assessment; profitability; sustainable development; Taiwan","","","","Gallo, Andrea, The Integrated ESG Approach to Assess Sustainability: An Application in the Food and Beverage Sector, Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering, pp. 423-431, (2023); Pinedo-López, Jhon William, Sustainability strategies: A proposal for food sector SMEs, based on the integration of life cycle assessment and ESG strategies, Journal of Infrastructure, Policy and Development, 8, 12, (2024); Finance Economics and Industry for Sustainable Development Proceedings of the Ecoop 87 European Conference on Object Oriented Programming Paris France 1517 June 1987, (2024); Porechenkova, Varvara, CSR Reporting Practices: A Cross-Time Comparison of the Food & Beverage and Energy Industries in the U.S. Through Topic Modeling, Corporate Reputation Review, (2024); Paridhi, n., Impact of ESG Disclosures on Corporate Financial Performance: An Industry-Specific Analysis of Indian Firms, Business Strategy and Development, 8, 1, (2025); Boiral, Olivier, Assessing and managing environmental, social, and governance risks in agri-food companies, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 31, 6, pp. 5690-5708, (2024); Academy of Management Review, (1986); Situation of Taiwans Agricultural Trade and Export Strategy, (2017); Malaysian Journal of Society and Space, (2020); Huang, Tzu Yen, Agri-food supply chain for mitigation of volatilities in the role of intermediary: A case study of a mushroom trading company in Taiwan, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 52, pp. 447-454, (2016)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000976123"

The study employed generalized quadratic quantile regression techniques to unearth nuanced relationships within 154 publicly traded banks from 10 MENA region countries between 2011 and 2023. The results suggested a U-shaped relationship between bank risk-taking and environmental quality proxied by the environmental performance index EPI. This outcome indicated that initial advances in environmental quality were associated with reduced risk-taking, which may increase beyond a certain threshold. Furthermore, the moderating influence of bank size was substantial, as larger banks typically exhibited a more robust ability to manage environmental hazards without increasing their risk-taking behaviour. The implications for policy and practice are substantial, indicating that developing effective risk management strategies should consider both the size of banks and environmental improvements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","And Mena; Environmental Performance Index Epi; Environmental Quality Eq; Interaction; Nonlinear","","","","","Abbas, Faisal, Dynamics of Funding Liquidity and Risk-Taking: Evidence from Commercial Banks, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 14, 6, (2021); Abbate, Angela, Optimal monetary policy with the risk-taking channel, European Economic Review, 152, (2023); Alfaki, Ibrahim M.Abdalla, Oil rents, diversification and growth: Is there asymmetric dependence?

Moreover, it also examines whether digitalization and income diversification act as mediators (individual and serial) in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses were tested using data from Pakistan’s banking sector financial statements from 2017 to 2021. A two-step analytical approach was used: panel regression in STATA for initial hypothesis examination, followed by mediation analyses using bootstrapping in SPSS. In addition, mixed-effect ML regression was conducted to verify causation and ensure robust findings. Findings: Results demonstrate that BGD, digitalization and income diversification are positively associated with higher financial stability. Moreover, as hypothesized, both digitalization and income diversification individually and sequentially mediate the relationship between BGD and banks’ financial stability. Research limitations/implications: It is important to acknowledge the study’s limited five-year timeframe. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal board compositions, especially considering the study’s inclusion of up to 25% female directors on boards. Practical implications: Policymakers and top management should prioritize increasing the number of female directors on boards for diversity. Banks that involve female directors can benefit from the synergies between gender diversity and digitization, along with the unique perspectives these women offer. This cooperative dynamic enables banks to explore and capitalize on innovative income diversification opportunities, enter new markets and ensure financial stability. Social implications: Research findings emphasize promotion of gender equality and meritocracy through increased female director representation. This fosters a more inclusive and cooperative decision-making culture, benefiting individual banks and setting a model for other sectors. Ultimately, it contributes to greater social acceptance of women executives. Originality/value: The study reveals a novel mechanism, emphasizing the revolutionary impact of active female directors in tandem with digitalization, amplifying chances for income diversification and accelerating increased bank viability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commercial Banks; Digital Orientation; Female Directors; Financial Stability; Gender; Revenue Diversification; Serial Mediation","","","","This study funding is Supported by Philosophy and Social Sciences Excellent Innovation Team Construction foundation of Jiangsu province (SJSZ2020-20).","Abedifar, Pejman, Non-interest income and bank lending, Journal of Banking and Finance, 87, pp. 411-426, (2018); National Assembly of Pakistan, (2017); Aksoy, Mine, Does board diversity affect the cost of debt financing?

Further, it endeavors to investigate the moderating role of heightened climate policy uncertainty (CPU) in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: To verify these hypotheses, the authors first construct a corporate innovation index for India using a sophisticated natural language processing model on each firm-year’s management discussion and analysis reports. Next, the authors use a panel fixed effects model to examine how ESG performance impacts corporate innovation and its moderating and mediating components. Findings: Empirical evidence suggests higher ESG performance bolsters text-based corporate innovation. After addressing endogeneity issues with the system GMM estimator and two-stage least square IV, incorporating additional control variables and using alternative innovation measurement, the baseline results remain unchanged. Next, the authors find this link is mediated by reducing information asymmetry, financial constraints and managerial myopia. The authors also observe that increased CPU favorably moderates the ESG-innovation nexus. Additionally, the heterogeneity research shows that ESG only positively impacts innovation in specific industries and firms in their growth and mature life cycle phases. Practical implications: The results demonstrate that sustainable and ethical business practices can foster corporate innovation. Thus, this study may provide valuable insight for investors, managers and policymakers.

This paper delves into the complex landscape of multi-period portfolio selection, where the objective is to maximize wealth while minimizing investment risk. The core challenge of this research lies in addressing the complexity and uncertainty inherent in multi-period portfolio selection under stochastic conditions. The study introduces a framework for multi-period portfolio selection, considering N risky assets over T time periods. Stochastic return rates are modeled using a stochastic distribution, with the objective of maximizing wealth under risk constraints. The study presents an empirical case study involving the S&P500 market index, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed approach. Utilizing a random forest model, the paper predicts future returns, incorporating these predictions into a deterministic model via chance constraints. The contributions of the paper are substantial and multifaceted. Firstly, it introduces bankruptcy constraints, providing a more realistic approach to portfolio optimization and addressing an often-overlooked aspect of financial modeling. Secondly, transaction costs, a critical consideration in real-world scenarios, are integrated into the model, significantly enhancing the accuracy and practical relevance of portfolio optimization strategies. Thirdly, uncertainty management is rigorously tackled through stochastic approaches, ensuring the development of robust strategies that can accommodate varying market conditions. The paper also introduces risk-adjusted performance measures, enabling more informed decision-making by considering both risk and returns. Innovatively, this paper employs the Random Forest technique to predict return rates, thereby substantially enhancing the precision of investment predictions. Additionally, the Root System Growth Algorithm adds a heuristic dimension to problem-solving, effectively bridging the gap between computational and solution efficiency.

Results show that ESG scores have a significant positive impact on the company's green innovation, substantive and strategic green innovation. In addition, ESG scores primarily influence firm's green innovation through three channels: R&D expenditure, R&D human capital, and information transparency. Furthermore, the positive influence of ESG scores on a company's green innovation is more significant when the company has a higher shareholding ratio of the largest shareholder and institutional investors, as well as when it is a state-owned enterprise. Further researches show that only E-scores significantly positively impact green innovation. Additionally, ESG scores have significant positive impact on green innovation with a lag of 1–3 years, but no significant impact from the fourth year onwards.

In this study, we investigate the impact of carbon emissions on the market reaction to announcements of corporate restructuring activities. Using a sample of US firms, we find that investors discount the value of corporate restructuring announcements when firms have higher levels of carbon emissions. Our results indicate that emissions are negatively associated with cumulative abnormal returns (CAR), cumulative total returns (CTR), and buy and hold abnormal returns (BHAR) around announcements. This effect is more pronounced for firms with a lower risk of bankruptcy, those financially constrained, and those with lower growth opportunities. We also find that high emissions at announcements are negatively associated with post-restructuring financial and market performance.

Specifically, we examine family corporate venture capitalists’ patterns in syndicate partner relationships using a global sample of 3,130 coinvestments from 2007 to 2022. We find that family corporate venture capitalists are more likely than their nonfamily counterparts to coinvest with syndicate partners who possess a similar wealth of experience in terms of overall investment experience, industry experience, and specialization. Family corporate venture capitalists follow the expected homophilic behavior of family firms when selecting nonfamily partners. This phenomenon is less pronounced in larger syndicates wherein individual syndicate partners may have less influence and there may be looser bonds between coinvestors.

This research used 50 family companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2022 Theoretical framework: Referring to the RBV theory, we tried to design a conceptual framework that shows the role of the second generation to increase innovation in family companies in Indonesia. Apart from that, the conceptual framework also explains the relationship between secondary generation gender diversity, education and management experience in a TMT organization as a trigger for increased innovation in family companies. In the conceptual framework designed in this research, we also want to prove again the influence of family ownership and institutional ownership in encouraging innovation in family companies in Indonesia Method: We used 50 family companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2022. Sample selection was carried out using a purposive sampling technique. In our research, innovation in family companies is used as the dependent variable, as well as second generation, gender diversity, education, experience in organization/management (TMT), family ownership and institutional ownership. To control bias in the data, we also use control variables consisting of current ratio, fixed assets to total assets and leverage. The data analysis stages were carried out using binary logistic regression and Wald tests Results and Conclusions: We succeeded in proving that the second generation has a positive and significant influence on innovation in family companies in Indonesia. We also found that the diversity of types of education chosen by domestic CEOs encourages them to innovate in family companies. Furthermore, we also found that organizational/management experience has a positive and significant effect on innovation in family companies, while family ownership and institutional ownership do not have a significant effect on innovation in family companies. Thus we conclude that the second generation can encourage increased innovation in family companies in Indonesia.

Design/methodology/approach: Linear regression is used to analyze the annual reports of 150 nonfinancial firms that belong to the CAC All-tradable index for the period 2015–2023. Findings: The empirical results show that auditor expertise has a positive and significant effect on financial communication quality. Furthermore, board size reinforces the negative effect of discretionary accruals on financial communication quality. However, CEO duality and block ownership attenuate the positive effect of auditor expertise on the dependent variable. Research limitations/implications: Our research covers three areas of research, i.e. audit quality, corporate governance and financial communication research. It presents the moderator role of some governance mechanisms on the relation between audit and financial communication quality. Furthermore, it aims to identify best practices in the governance system that attempt to facilitate and improve the positive impact of audit quality on the quality of financial communication, which increases stakeholder confidence in the firm. We caution readers from generalizing the findings of this study, as our study is based on a well-developed sample. Also, it is limited only to annual reports to measure the financial communication index without looking at other information transmission channels.

Its aim is to develop, evaluate and validate a specific corporate governance index that overcomes the limitations of previous research, which relies on aggregated and unvalidated measures. The research questions are: How can corporate governance in Spain be adequately measured? And how well does the proposed index represent the relevant aspects of corporate governance? These questions lead to the sub-question of the validity of the sub-indices that make up the index in relation to specific aspects of corporate governance. The study analyses a sample of 130 Spanish listed companies with 1,039 observations corresponding to the period from 2007 to 2018. An aggregate corporate governance index is constructed, composed of four sub-indices: compliance with good governance codes, ownership characteristics, board characteristics and transparency of accounting information. The results show that both the overall index and the sub-indices are positively related to firm value. Methods such as Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for internal consistency and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for index structure are used to validate the index. In addition, panel data analysis using the GMM method is employed, incorporating a novel measure of firm value that takes into account the replacement cost of assets. This study fills a gap in the literature by constructing and validating a specific index for Spain, while addressing econometric issues such as endogeneity and unobservable heterogeneity. In practical terms, the index can support the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, which promotes the adoption of good governance codes. Finally, it is suggested that future research should focus on creating and validating robust indices to assess the quality of corporate governance in other contexts, thereby promoting best practices globally. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boards Of Directors; Codes Of Good Governance; Construct Validity; Corporate Governance Index; Financial Reportingfirm Value; Ownership Structure","","","","Paolo Saona gratefully acknowledges the research funding received from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, ref.

Analysis exhibits a positive relationship between sustainability reporting, investor sentiments, and firm reputation. Strong sustainability practices correlate with more positive investor sentiment and enhanced firm reputation, aligning with sustainable development principles.

This systematic literature review of 9034 studies synthesizes 68 peer-reviewed articles and develops a behavioral typology of five bank responses: recovery, containment, repricing, reallocation, and relational transformation. Responses vary by risk type, visibility, and salience. Acute, unexpected physical risks (nine studies) trigger recovery lending, while expected (five) or chronic risks (12) lead to containment or repricing. Transition risks (42) are more consistently priced when indicators are quantifiable and policy-aligned; softer ESG signals elicit conditional responses. Asymmetries arise: recovery and containment occur only for physical risks, while strategic reallocation remains rare. Carbon-intensive firms are penalized, while green firms benefit only when performance is credible and verifiable. We propose a diagnostic framework to evaluate climate risk management in lending, providing a novel tool to assess climate risk integration in bank lending and inform regulatory design and sustainability-oriented strategy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Lending; Climate Risk; Cost Of Capital; Credit Risk; Credit Spreads; Transition Risk","","","","","Abedifar, Pejman, Flood, farms and credit: The role of branch banking in the era of climate change, Journal of Corporate Finance, 85, (2024); Adu, Douglas Akwasi, Bank climate change initiatives, ownership structures, and corporate governance mechanisms: Evidence from emerging economies, Business Strategy and the Environment, 33, 4, pp. 3039-3077, (2024); Al-Fakir Al Rabab'a, Eltayyeb, Corporate carbon performance and cost of debt: Evidence from Asia-Pacific countries, International Review of Financial Analysis, 88, (2023); Alshahrani, Faisal, Climate change performance and financial distress, Business Strategy and the Environment, 32, 6, pp. 3249-3271, (2023); Aslan, Çağlayan, Does climate change affect bank lending behavior?, Economics Letters, 220, (2022); Atz, Ulrich, Does sustainability generate better financial performance? review, meta-analysis, and propositions, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 13, 1, pp. 802-825, (2023); Bae, Sung C., Corporate social responsibility, credit rating, and private debt contracting: new evidence from syndicated loan market, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 50, 1, pp. 261-299, (2018); Bassetti, Thomas, Firms’ borrowing costs and neighbors’ flood risk, Small Business Economics, 64, 3, pp. 917-933, (2025); Battiston, Stefano, Climate risks and financial stability, Journal of Financial Stability, 54, (2021); Climate Related Risk Drivers and their Transmission Channels, (2021)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015335918"

Focusing on Italian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as a case study and using firm-level data from the AIDA database for the year 2022, the analysis compares results from the non-spatial probit model with the probit spatial autoregressive and spatial Durbin models. The findings demonstrate that spatial models consistently outperform the non-spatial specification in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, particularly when the spatial proximity parameter is optimally defined. Moreover, the results show that financial distress tends to cluster geographically, and that firms’ default risk is influenced not only by intra-firm indicators but also by the characteristics of nearby firms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Default Risk; Small And Medium Enterprises; Spatial Finance; Spatial Probit Model","","","","","Ben Abdallah, Nadia, The Contribution of Spatial Econometrics in the Field of Empirical Finance, Review of Economics and Finance, 20, pp. 17-31, (2022); Agosto, Arianna, Spatial Regression Models to Improve P2P Credit Risk Management, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 2, (2019); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2014); Altman, Edward I., Revisiting SME default predictors: The Omega Score, Journal of Small Business Management, 61, 6, pp. 2383-2417, (2023); Altman, Edward I., Financial Distress Prediction in an International Context: A Review and Empirical Analysis of Altman's Z-Score Model, Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 28, 2, pp. 131-171, (2017); Altman, Edward I., Assessing the credit worthiness of Italian SMEs and mini-bond issuers, Global Finance Journal, 43, (2020); Arbia, Giuseppe, On the Spatial Determinants of Firm Growth: A Microlevel Analysis of the Italian SMEs, 2, pp. 89-120, (2020); Arcuri, Giuseppe, Spatial patterns and determinants of firm exit: an empirical analysis on France, Annals of Regional Science, 62, 1, pp. 99-118, (2019); Arnold, Matthias, Modeling different kinds of spatial dependence in stock returns, Empirical Economics, 44, 2, pp. 761-774, (2013); Barro, Diana, Credit contagion in a network of firms with spatial interaction, European Journal of Operational Research, 205, 2, pp. 459-468, (2010)","","Sage Publications India Pvt.

Drawing on upper-echelon and intergroup threat theories, we posit that innate values on risk aversion and the ethicality of female directors lead gender-diverse boards to display higher negative emotions in risk management disclosures. Design/methodology/approach We empirically test our postulation on a sample of banks from 12 emerging economies over the period 2005–2020 and develop a sentiment index using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme. We employ the system GMM estimation technique to address potential endogeneity issues in our models, ensuring more reliable and robust parameter estimates. Findings We find a positive association between the presence of female directors and negative sentiments in risk management disclosures. However, the number of females on board must reach the critical mass of at least three females to observe negative sentiments in risk management disclosures. Practical implications Our results exhibit important implications for theory and practitioners, particularly investors and regulators in emerging markets. Our study advocates for a more heterogeneous board, suggesting that the inclusion of more than two females is necessary to capitalize on the advantages of gender diversity in board dynamics. Hence, gender-diverse managerial sentiments enrich the risk-related information, which conveys valuable information to investors and regulators. Investors should include sentiments-driven information in the comprehensive analysis of firms’ disclosures. Regulators may observe the signals emerging from risk management sentiment as a tool for better bank supervision to avoid huge losses to the stakeholders.

We constructed an appropriate proxy index of CER using principal component analysis (PCA) which revealed that CER is based on three pillars: (i) energy monitoring and efficiency, (ii) greenhouse gas emissions, and (iii) pollutants' emissions. To address reverse causality and endogeneity biases, we employed two-stage least squares (2SLS) analyses and instrumental probit (IVProbit) regression. Results show that CER positively influences research and development expenditures, external knowledge acquisition, and product and process innovation. In contrast, CER negatively affects firm performance. In addition, the findings prove that corporate innovation has a mediating role between environmental responsibility and firm performance. These results imply that investing in environmental responsibility can improve innovation and competitiveness of Eastern European SMEs. Yet, managers also need to be aware of the potential detrimental consequences on short-term firm performance. Overall, the results suggest that firms in Eastern Europe may face trade-offs between environmental responsibility and financial performance. While environmental responsibility may lead to increased innovation, it may also have negative effects on firm performance. Accordingly, firms have to carefully take into consideration the costs and benefits of implementing environmental practices and seek ways to balance their environmental and financial goals. The development of more effective environmental regulations and support mechanisms tailored to SMEs by governments and policymakers can neutralize this negative effect. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Environmental Responsibility; Corporate Innovation; Energy Efficiency; Firm Performance; Pollutant Emissions","","","","","Abdi, Hervé, Principal component analysis, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics, 2, 4, pp. 433-459, (2010); Aboal, Diego, Innovation and productivity in services and manufacturing: The role of ICT, Industrial and Corporate Change, 27, 2, pp. 221-241, (2018); Adomako, Samuel, Proactive environmental strategy and firm performance at the bottom of the pyramid, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 1, pp. 422-431, (2021); Afshar Jahanshahi, Asghar, Antecedents of corporate environmental commitments: The role of customers, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 6, (2018); Iosr Journal of Business and Management, (2013); Aghion, Philippe, The causal effects of competition on innovation: Experimental evidence, Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 34, 2, pp. 162-195, (2018); Andries, Petra, Environmental innovation and firm performance: How firm size and motives matter, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 13, (2019); Ardito, Lorenzo, The influence of production, IT, and logistics process innovations on ambidexterity performance, Business Process Management Journal, 24, 5, pp. 1271-1284, (2018); Barney, Jay Bryan, Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: A ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 643-650, (2001); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

To test our conceptual model, we conducted a survey in Hungary in 2024, with 249 respondents completing our online questionnaire. The model and hypotheses were evaluated using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that the intention to use robo-advisors is most significantly influenced by performance expectancy, trust, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Among the AI attributes, perceived intelligence stands out, exerting an indirect effect on the intention to use through the aforementioned factors. A limitation of our study is its’ geographical focus on Hungary, restricting the generalizability of the findings to potential Hungarian users. Additionally, we were unable to investigate actual usage due to the currently low service penetration. Understanding the factors that influence the preference for automated investment management solutions over traditional advisors is essential for marketing managers in fintech companies to devise effective client acquisition and retention strategies. The findings highlight the importance of trust, security, and digital literacy. Addressing these factors is vital for maximizing the benefits and mitigating the risks associated with AI in financial services. The originality lies in its integrated examination of perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism within an extended UTAUT model, uncovering their combined effects on the intention to use robo-advisors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Acceptance; Hungary; Intention; Robo-advisors; Technology Adoption","","","","","Machkour, Badr, Industry 4.0 and its implications for the financial sector, Procedia Computer Science, 177, pp. 496-502, (2020); Barroso, Marta, Digital transformation and the emergence of the Fintech sector: Systematic literature review, Digital Business, 2, 2, (2022); Windasari, Nila Armelia, Digital-only banking experience: Insights from gen Y and gen Z, Journal of Innovation and Knowledge, 7, 2, (2022); Tiberius, Victor, Forecasting the future of robo advisory: A three-stage Delphi study on economic, technological, and societal implications, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 182, (2022); Nagadeepa, C., Upsurge of Robo Advisors: Integrating Customer Acceptance, pp. 351-381, (2023); Disruptive Impact of Fintech on Retirement Systems, (2019); Finance Economy, (2025); Robo Advisor in A New World of Intense 401 K Anxiety Brought about by the Enron Fiasco the Only Hand Investors May have to Hold May Be Digital, (2002); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2018); Dluhopolskyi, Oleksandr V., Digital Financial Inclusion: COVID-19 Impacts and Opportunities, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 3, (2023)","","Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution","","","","","","17858860","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013756575"

We argue that earnings pressure negatively impacts ESG performance, as it leads executives to prioritize short-term financial gains over ESG activities with uncertain or delayed financial returns. Moreover, we posit that executives with environmental experience are less likely to reduce ESG efforts under earnings pressure, whereas those with MBA backgrounds are more inclined to do so. Using a fixed effects model, we empirically analyze data from Chinese listed manufacturing firms (2010–2021), finding strong support for these hypotheses.

This trend is particularly prominent in China, whose unique institutional environment and transitional economy provide an ideal laboratory for examining the impact of financialization on corporate risk. Departing from prior research that treats financial assets as homogeneous, this study disaggregates them by liquidity into short-term and long-term categories to uncover their heterogeneous effects on financial risk. Using a dataset of listed Chinese construction and manufacturing firms from 2014 to 2023, we find that financial asset allocation has a significant “double-edged sword” effect on financial risk. On one hand, the allocation to highly liquid, short-term financial assets creates a “reservoir effect,” significantly mitigating financial risk by easing financing constraints. On the other hand, the allocation to less liquid, long-term financial assets exhibits a “crowding-out effect,” diverting funds from core operations and thus significantly increasing financial risk. This risk-amplifying effect is particularly pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and large-scale firms. The core contribution of this study is to reveal the opposing effects and underlying mechanisms of financial assets with different liquidities on corporate financial risk, challenging the conventional view of corporate financialization as a monolithic phenomenon. Our findings provide micro-level evidence for managers to optimize asset allocation by balancing “precautionary savings” with “speculative investments,” and offer important insights for regulators to design more targeted, differentiated policies to safeguard against systemic risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Liquidity; Corporate Financialization; Crowding-out Effect; Financial Risk; Financing Constraints; Architecture; Asset Management; Decentralized Finance; Economics; Asset Allocation; Asset Liquidity; Construction Firms; Corporate Financialization; Corporates; Crowding Out; Crowding-out Effect; Financial Assets; Financial Risks; Financing Constraints; Investments","Architecture; Asset management; Decentralized finance; Economics; Asset allocation; Asset liquidity; Construction firms; Corporate financialization; Corporates; Crowding out; Crowding-out effect; Financial assets; Financial risks; Financing constraints; Investments","","","","Abedin, Mohammad Zoynul, Forward-looking disclosure effects on stock liquidity in China: Evidence from MD&A text analysis, International Review of Financial Analysis, 95, (2024); Baños-Caballero, Sonia, Working capital management, corporate performance, and financial constraints, Journal of Business Research, 67, 3, pp. 332-338, (2014); Barney, Keith, Credit crunch: Chinese infrastructure lending and Lao sovereign debt, Asia and the Pacific Policy Studies, 8, 1, pp. 94-113, (2021); Borri, Nicola, Systemic risk and the COVID challenge in the european banking sector, Journal of Banking and Finance, 140, (2022); Chen, Han, Does technology innovation in finance alleviate financing constraints and reduce debt-financing costs?

Further, we consider alternative measurements of variables, structural breaks and apply the Hayes (2018. Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis, second edition: A regression-based approach. Guilford Press) bootstrapping approach for moderated mediation analysis. The comprehensive analysis provides several unique findings. First, we find that cross-ownership positively influences both CR and GI. Second, we document unique evidence that a firm’s GI significantly mediates the association between cross-ownership and CR. Third, the moderated mediation analysis suggests that CEO power (i.e. ownership, structural, and expert dimensions) moderates the mediating effect of GI on the relationship between cross-ownership and CR. Fourth, we find that CEO power has a significant positive moderating effect on the association between cross-ownership and CR such that the positive relationship is stronger when the CEO has more power in the firm. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Power; Corporate Reputation; Cross-ownership; Green Innovation; Moderated Mediation Analysis","","","","This study was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (20BGL099).","Abdullah, undefined, Impact of working capital management on firm profitability and liquidity: the moderating role of family ownership, Accounting Research Journal, 35, 5, pp. 676-697, (2022); Abdullah, undefined, Exploring the influence of green innovation, ESG performance, and corporate reputation on stock market performance: A mediated moderation perspective, Environment, Development and Sustainability, (2024); Adams, Renée B., Powerful CEOs and their impact on corporate performance, Review of Financial Studies, 18, 4, pp. 1403-1432, (2005); Aguinis, Herman, Improving Our Understanding of Moderation and Mediation in Strategic Management Research, Organizational Research Methods, 20, 4, pp. 665-685, (2017); Ai, Mingye, Green innovation and corporate financial performance: Insights from operating risks, Journal of Cleaner Production, 456, (2024); Alahdal, Waleed M., The moderating role of CEO power on the relationship between environmental, social and governance disclosure and financial performance in emerging market, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 36, pp. 85803-85821, (2023); Athari, Seyed Alireza, The effects of institutional settings and risks on bank dividend policy in an emerging market: Evidence from Tobit model, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 3, pp. 4493-4515, (2021); Athari, Seyed Alireza, Do governance settings moderate the effect of country risk on firms' cash holdings?

Using an unbalanced panel dataset of 117,410 firm-year observations from five regions, representing 11 industries and operating in 71 countries from 2013 to 2022, our findings reveal that climate change initiatives significantly enhance firm performance. Our results further exhibit that the interaction effects of gender diversity at the board and TMT levels (the trickle-down effect) support climate change initiatives by encouraging environmental management training (EMT), thereby improving firm performance. To address the potential endogeneity issues, we employed a two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. Our empirical results are robust to endogeneity and alternative measures. Overall, our evidence supports the Resource-Based View Theory and Upper Echelon Theory to demonstrate how a diverse TMT and board members can contribute to more robust climate change strategies by using EMT as a resource to achieve performance objectives. Hence, we make important contributions to the corporate governance and environmentalism strands of the literature by highlighting the role of gender in shaping climate change initiatives and influencing firm performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change Initiatives; Environmental Management Training; Firm Performance; Gender Diversity; Trickle-down Effect","","","","","Abdullah, Shamsul Nahar, Does having women on boards create value? the impact of societal perceptions and corporate governance in emerging markets, Strategic Management Journal, 37, 3, pp. 466-476, (2016); Journal of Business and Management Review, (2022); Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Afum, Ebenezer, Sustainability excellence: the interactions of lean production, internal green practices and green product innovation, International Journal of Lean Six Sigma, 12, 6, pp. 1089-1114, (2021); Agoraki, Konstantina K., The relationship between firm-level climate change exposure, financial integration, cost of capital and investment efficiency, Journal of International Money and Finance, 141, (2024); Ahmed, Rizwan, Green bonds as a bridge to the UN sustainable development goals on environment: A climate change empirical investigation, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 29, 2, pp. 2428-2451, (2024); Al-Najjar, Basil, Mind the gap: Are female directors and executives more sensitive to the environment in high-tech us firms?, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 184, (2022); Álvarez, Isabel Gallego, Impact of CO 2 Emission Variation on Firm Performance, Business Strategy and the Environment, 21, 7, pp. 435-454, (2012); Amorelli, María Florencia, Trends in the dynamic evolution of board gender diversity and corporate social responsibility, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 28, 2, pp. 537-554, (2021); Arayssi, Mahmoud, The impact of board composition on the level of ESG disclosures in GCC countries, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 11, 1, pp. 137-161, (2020)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","aip","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010446642"

By examining these characteristics in an integrated manner, the research offers deeper insights into the organizational factors that support the establishment of strong ethical practices. Design/methodology/approach: The study identifies key attributes connected with ethics institutionalization using a complex of diverse background variables such as organizational size, regional location, industry, ownership type, legal form, organizational age, profitability and professional association membership. A two-step cluster analysis and Chi-square tests were conducted on a representative sample of 1,295 Slovak organizations, stratified by company size and region. Findings: In the subset of micro/small organizations, high ethics institutionalization is linked with private foreign ownership, the construction industry and company location in Western Slovakia. For medium/large companies, ethics institutionalization is connected with foreign ownership, presence in the capital city region, joint stock structure, association membership and profitability. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited to organizations operating within Slovakia, which may impact the generalizability of findings to other regions. In addition, the study focused on a defined set of organizational characteristics, potentially overlooking other factors that could influence ethics institutionalization. Practical implications: This research highlights which segments of businesses may benefit most from targeted ethical policies, offering managers a foundation for more effective decision-making in organizational ethics. The study’s findings can help policymakers identify specific business segments or company types needing additional regulatory guidance or support. Social implications: As businesses implement more robust ethical frameworks, they contribute to raising standards across the market, promoting fair practices and reducing the occurrence of unethical behavior in business, which can have broad societal benefits. Originality/value: This research advances theoretical and practical understanding of organizational ethics by examining a range of organizational characteristics, rarely explored in conjunction, with respect to ethics institutionalization. The uniqueness of this study also lies in its focus on one of the Central and Eastern European countries, a context that remains understudied in business ethics, providing valuable perspectives on a posttransformation business environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Ethics; Central And Eastern Europe; Company Size; Ethics Institutionalization; Ethics Program; Formal Ethics Elements; Organizational Ethics","","","","","Adams, Dawda, Social and environmental practices and corporate financial performance of multinational corporations in emerging markets: Evidence from 20 oil-rich African countries, Resources Policy, 78, (2022); Agarwala, Nidhi, Do firm attributes impact CSR participation?

Additionally, it explores variations in this impact across different stages of the enterprise life cycle. Design/methodology/approach: This study treats the official incorporation of Chinese A-shares into the MSCI as a quasi-natural experiment. Using data from A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020, it applies a double difference model to rigorously analyze the effect of capital market internationalization on auditor risk response behavior. Findings: The results indicate that following capital market internationalization, auditors of listed companies exhibit reduced audit input and lower audit fees. This suppressive effect is primarily observed in the mature phase of the enterprise life cycle. Further analysis reveals that the influence of capital market internationalization is achieved mainly by easing financing constraints for listed companies and enhancing the optimism conveyed through management’s language. This effect is more pronounced among enterprises characterized by higher levels of management myopia and superior internal control quality. Economic consequence tests demonstrate that reducing auditors’ audit input and fees after A-share inclusion in the MSCI index contributes to decreasing enterprise risk-taking and the likelihood of senior management changes.

In light of this, we present a promising approach for investigating the key levers of financial sustainability from a variety of financial indicators. The empirical investigation focuses on the financial performance of major luxury players from 2017 to 2022, starting from the analysis of 20 financial indicators sourced from the literature. Given the multi-layer structure of the data, Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis (HMFA) is employed to discern the primary dimensions of financial sustainability over time. Then, mixed-effects model is used to estimate organizations’ stock market performance using the extracted factors, while considering both fixed and random effects. Empirical findings reveal that financial sustainability encompasses four strategic dimensions, with profitability being the main catalyst for enhancing company value and attracting investors’ interests. Finally, this novel approach offers a new and integrated method, including metric and graphical tools, to measure corporate financial sustainability and recognize patterns at every level of the hierarchy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Statement Analysis; Financial Sustainability; Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis; Luxury Industry; Mixed-effects Model","","","","Demaria gratefully acknowledges financial support from the PRIN project \u201CTowards a Circular Economy: A Business Model Innovation Perspective\u201D, project code: 2022STRZYZ (CUP: E53D23006450006).

Moreover, the inhibitory effect is very pronounced for firms with low analyst attention and firms that do not hire a top-ten domestic audit firm, and this inhibitory effect is mainly driven by social responsibility (S dimension) and governance (G dimension) We also found that ESG performance can improve the price efficiency of the capital market.

The study applies event study to investigate the impact on returns and autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)–based models to measure the impact of M&A on volatility. The possibility of earning trading gains has been explored through t-test. The results reveal that though the average abnormal return was not significant during most of the days, there were statistically significant cumulative average abnormal returns during the post-window period. Further, short-term investments can generate intermediate gains in addition to the immediate cumulative profits. The ARCH-based models indicate that M&A had substantial influence on 16 stocks. The volatility came down in the case of 16 stocks after the announcement of M&A, and this effect was significant in 12 stocks. However, a significant positive impact on volatility was also observed in four stocks.The findings are useful for investors, corporates as well as market regulators to take appropriate decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arch-based Models; Event Study; Mergers And Acquisitions; Stock Returns; Volatility","","","","","International Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2016); Anand, Jaideep (Jay), Asset redeployment, acquisitions and corporate strategy in declining industries, Strategic Management Journal, 18, SPEC.

Using data from 4,735 non-financial listed firms from 18 emerging markets over the ""special"" period 1990-2007, results indicate that asset tangibility, firm size, private credit to GDP, and the creditor protection index are associated with higher leverage ratios, while profitability, growth opportunities, the shareholder protection index, stock market size, the legality index, GDP growth rate, and inflation rate are associated with lower leverage ratios. Using the panel data approach, results also indicate that the tangibility of assets and the shareholder rights index are the most prominent determinants of capital structure. Furthermore, the research suggests that the debt-equity choice decisions of firms differ according to geographical origin, legal origin, and financial system development. Differences also exist at the sectoral level. Results finally show that the Asian financial crisis had effects on capital structure determinants. We detect significant upward trends in four different leverage ratios before and during the eruption of the financial and banking crisis. After the crisis, asset tangibility, profitability, and the creditor rights index influence the firm’s capital structure determinants differently. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asian Crisis; Country-specific Determinants; Financial System Development; Firm-specific Determinants; Geographic Region; Industrial Sector; Legal Origin; Leverage Ratios","","","","","Corporate Ownership and Control, (2023); Abdulla, Yomna, Capital structure in a tax-free economy: evidence from UAE, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 10, 1, pp. 102-116, (2017); Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, Industry classification and the capital structure of Ghanaian SMEs, Studies in Economics and Finance, 24, 3, pp. 207-219, (2007); Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, Investment opportunities, corporate finance, and dividend payout policy: Evidence from emerging markets, Studies in Economics and Finance, 27, 3, pp. 180-194, (2010); Adair, Philippe, Trade-off theory vs. Pecking order theory and the determinants of corporate leverage: Evidence from a panel data analysis upon french SMEs (2002–2010), Cogent Economics and Finance, 3, 1, (2015); Ownership Structure and Initial Public Offerings, (2003); Agyei, James, Trade-Off Theory Versus Pecking Order Theory: Ghanaian Evidence, SAGE Open, 10, 3, (2020); International Journal of Management and Commerce Innovations, (2013); Ahmed, Amanj Mohamed, The Relationship between Capital Structure and Firm Performance: The Moderating Role of Agency Cost, Risks, 11, 6, (2023); Akbar, Saeed, Capital structure dynamics of Shariah-compliant vs noncompliant firms: evidence from Pakistan, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 16, 2, pp. 366-383, (2023)","","Asian Economic and Social Society","","","","","","23052147; 22226737","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006525505"

It employs a quantitative methodology to analyze data from industrial firms listed on the Palestine Stock Exchanges from 2016 to 2022. The analysis utilizes multivariate regression and Sobel tests. The results indicate that CEO characteristics have a significant effect on share prices. While CEO education and experience show a marginally positive influence, CEO age appears to have a slight negative impact. The analysis also reveals that CEO and firm age negatively correlate with share price, in contrast to firm size and leverage, which exert positive impacts. Further, while CEO characteristics significantly influence SGR, the study finds that most CEO attributes, except for CEO age, do not significantly affect SGR. Despite SGR having a notable impact on share prices, it insignificantly mediates the relationship between CEO characteristics and share prices. Control variables included in the study indicate that firm age negatively correlates with share prices, while firm size and leverage are associated with positive effects. This research enriches the literature by mapping out the pathways through which CEO characteristics can affect share prices and highlights the importance of these attributes in investment decision-making and firm valuation strategies.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on European bank database from 2010 to 2021. The authors classified the variables into groups based on their nature. Z-score return on assets (ROA) and Z-score return on risk-weighted assets (RORWA) were used to test these determinants. This study used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and applied the approaches proposed by Ahrens et al. (2020). The selected indicators were analysed using the theoretical framework of positive and normative accounting theories. Findings: A selection of indicators from four groups of variables stands out because of their high coefficients in all samples: financial instruments, income statement impact, loan quality and macroeconomic variables. The selected groups of indicators are similar for all banks. However, the indicators selected to identify banking distress vary according to bank category (global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and financial conglomerates (FICO)). This study shows the importance of investment portfolio risk management and its impact on bank performance. Secondly, it highlights the informative value of the loan loss provisioning indicator and the default rate introduced by International Financial Reporting Standards 9. Finally, this study discusses the role of financial information and accounting standards theory as a decision-making tool for future activities.

Delisting is a well-studied phenomenon with numerous studies documenting its key drivers. However, these studies conceptualise delisting as a transition from a listed to a delisted state. Such an approach ignores the reality of a typical delisting process which is usually characterised by numerous distress episodes, before the final delisting (absorbing event). In this paper, we model the role of intermediate financial distress events and business cycles in stock market delisting using an extended Cox model. In addition to assessing financial distress events, the study also assesses the role of business cycles in explaining delisting. The current study, therefore, contributes to the literature on delisting by conceptualising delisting as a system-wide multistate framework, incorporating intermediate distress episodes. This approach sheds light on curative measures that can be employed by policymakers to resolve distress and reduce the rate of delisting on the stock exchange. Additionally, the study adopts models that appropriately handle time-dependent covariates such as business cycles, approaches that are not found in studies that commonly use binary approaches to understand delisting. We find the length of distress spells; consecutive income losses, and composite lead business cycle indicators as significant factors in explaining delisting. Intermediate distress events and business cycle indicators can therefore be used as early warning indicators for delisting and stress-testing variables in ascertaining the potential impact of changing economic conditions on delisting respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Finance; Delisting; Distress; Economics; Finance; Industry & Industrial Studies; Johannesburg Stock Exchange; Stock Market; Survival Analysis; Time To Event","","","","","Abad, David, The short-term debt choice under asymmetric information, SERIEs, 8, 3, pp. 261-285, (2017); Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences, (2024); Rise of Domestic Capital Markets for Corporate Financing, (2019); Acosta-González, Eduardo, Predicting Corporate Financial Failure Using Macroeconomic Variables and Accounting Data, Computational Economics, 53, 1, pp. 227-257, (2019); Future Business Journal, (2024); Overview of Africas Financial Sector Long Term Finance and Capital Markets1, (2023); Uncertainty in Economics, (1978); Alfaro, Laura, Corporate debt, firm size and financial fragility in emerging markets, Journal of International Economics, 118, pp. 1-19, (2019); Algebaly, Esam Aldin M., The determinants of involuntary delisting rate in the Egyptian IPO equity market, Review of Accounting and Finance, 13, 2, pp. 171-190, (2014); V.k, Anand Krishnan, A bibliometric review of Market Microstructure literature: Current status, development, and future directions, Finance Research Letters, 69, (2024)","","Cogent OA","","","","","","23322039","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004641861"

We compare subdivided ESG indexes—such as security, water, and diversity—with general ESG and pillar indexes over a 10-year period, including the stressed COVID-19 period. Results show that subdivided indexes offer higher SRs, lower correlations, and enhanced diversification. Notably, energy and GHG indexes outperform pillar counterparts in elasticity across both periods. Using Modern Portfolio Theory, we integrate these assets into a benchmark portfolio of stocks, real estate, and bonds, achieving a 38% SR and 6% Diversification Ratio improvement. A two-step portfolio construction approach further enhances performance, especially during stressed markets. The Shapley Value method confirms that subdivided ESG assets positively contribute to excess returns while mitigating downside risks.

The objective of this study is to analyse the current and future trends in merger processes in the context of two research aspects: 1) the relationship with governance principles in both private and public sector organizations and 2) the current situation and prospects for international or domestic mergers. In order to fulfill the research objectives, a criterion-based selection and analysis of relevant literature were conducted — articles selected from an authoritative database (Scopus). It was found that in the context of corporate mergers, governance theory is of critical importance because the quality of governance can influence post-merger outcomes, and effective corporate governance mechanisms can mitigate risks arising from the behaviour of managers or employees. Based on the result of this study, it is suggested that the research in the field of mergers and governance mechanisms can significantly benefit from further studies that include the advanced analysis of various countries with diverse economic environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Governance; Literature Review; Merger; Performance","","","","","Aggarwal, Puja, Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on Accounting-based Performance of Acquiring Firms in India, Global Business Review, 23, 1, pp. 218-236, (2022); Bartocci, Luca, The journey of participatory budgeting: a systematic literature review and future research directions, International Review of Administrative Sciences, 89, 3, pp. 757-774, (2023); Battisti, Enrico, Past, present, and future of mergers and acquisitions in the MENA region: a systematic review and integrative framework, International Studies of Management and Organization, 51, 3, pp. 276-296, (2021); Busalim, Abdelsalam H.H., Understanding social commerce: A systematic literature review and directions for further research, International Journal of Information Management, 36, 6, pp. 1075-1088, (2016); Candra, Ade, Literature review on merger and acquisition, Estudios de Economia Aplicada, 39, 4, (2021); Giovanis, Nikolaos, Morphology of mergers and their impact on performance and accounting metrics in HEIs: evidence from a small European country, Studies in Higher Education, (2024); International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics, (2025); Golubov, Andrey, Empirical mergers and acquisitions research: A review of methods, evidence and managerial implications, pp. 287-313, (2013); Kafestidis, Stylianos, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS EXPANSION AND MERGER INVESTMENT RISK STRATEGIES BY PROMOTING INNOVATION AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY: A CASE STUDY ANALYSIS, Risk Governance and Control: Financial Markets and Institutions, 14, 4, pp. 89-95, (2024); Kayser, Christoph, Understanding the Relevance of Sustainability in Mergers and Acquisitions—A Systematic Literature Review on Sustainability and Its Implications throughout Deal Stages, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 2, (2024)","","Virtus Interpress","","","","","","22209352; 23066784","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003929928"

The ordinary least square regression and two-step system GMM techniques are used extensively to analyze the panel data, which is analyzed using Stata software. The annual reports of Islamic and conventional banks are used to collect data. Findings: The findings reveal that SDGs adoption is positively and significantly related to the financial performance of Islamic banks while negatively to conventional banks. This distinction results from Islamic finance’s innate moral and social tenets that are compatible with sustainability objectives. The findings significantly add to our understanding of the financial dynamics of Islamic and conventional banking and the conversation about the financial institutions’ role in promoting sustainable development. These findings have ramifications that provide stakeholders, financial institutions and legislators with a foundation upon which to think when incorporating sustainable practices into banking processes.

A considerable proportion of Indonesian business owners, particularly those who are dependent on imported raw materials, are profoundly concerned about the depreciation of the country's currency. It is possible that the following may lead to substantial discrepancies in the cost of producing raw materials in comparison to the earlier projections, which will necessitate a significant amount of financial resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the Return on Assets (ROA), Fixed Asset Ratio (FAR), and Current Ratio (CR) and the Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER) in extractive firms that are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2018 to 2022. Out of a total of 84 extractive companies, a sample size of 18 enterprises was selected by using purposive sampling technique. Within the scope of the study, a multiple regression analysis was conducted using a robust panel data model. The findings of the study indicated that profitability, as determined by return on assets (ROA), and liquidity, as represented by current ratio (CR), have the potential to have a large and detrimental effect on capital structure. Meanwhile, the asset structure, as assessed by the Fixed Asset Ratio (FAR), had no impact on the capital structure. This study has the potential to assist firms in determining the critical components that determine the optimal balance of debt and equity, which ultimately result in improved financial performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Structure; Capital Structure; Indonesia; Liquidity; Panel Data Analysis; Profitability","","","","","Indonesian Financial Review, (2022); Economic and Development, (2020); Ang, James S., An alternate test of Myers' pecking order theory of capital structure: the case of South Korean firms, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 1, 1, pp. 31-46, (1993); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2016); Ardalan, Kavous, Capital structure theory: Reconsidered, Research in International Business and Finance, 39, pp. 696-710, (2017); Jursima, (2022); Advances in Economics Business and Management Research, (2019); Accounting Analysis Journal, (2019); Bui, Dien Giau, Managerial ability and financial statement disaggregation decisions, Journal of Empirical Finance, 74, (2023); Cappa, Francesco, The impact of corporate strategy on capital structure: evidence from Italian listed firms, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 76, pp. 379-385, (2020)","","Malque Publishing","","","","","","26751240","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001204049"

CDLCs are Chinese companies that have core businesses in China and simultaneously list their shares in the Hong Kong and the China A-share markets. One hundred CDLCs are chosen for this research from 2003 to 2019. A binary variable of state control firm attribute (SCFA) is created to proxy the political connections to the Chinese government. The standard deviation of daily stock return and the mean of the natural logarithm of squared daily stock return are the two proxies of firm risk. The regression results show that the SCFA negatively influences the firm risk. Thus, the political connections, proxied by the SCFA, mitigate the firm risk. However, the state ownership’s influence on firm risk is insignificant. The regression results are supportive of our argument that SCFA and state ownership are two distinct concepts. Both the board size and independent director ratio insignificantly influence the firm risk. The CEO duality cannot be concluded to positively influences the firm risk and is not a destabilising factor in CDLCs.

As global economies shift toward sustainability and equity, there is growing recognition of the need to support Indigenous peoples in accessing finance, technology, and resources necessary to create sustainable growth. By creating inclusive financial systems, promoting Indigenous-led entrepreneurship, and investing in community-driven projects, communities and local businesses can bridge the gap between historical inequities and modern economic opportunities. Exploring this approach may benefit Indigenous communities while contributing to the goals of economic resilience, cultural preservation, and environmental stewardship. The Future of Indigenous Inclusivity: Unlocking Finance for Economic Development explores the intersection of Indigenous communities and new financial practices for improved Indigenous economic development. It examines solutions to address the challenges presented by Indigenous community development, policymaking, service improvement, and inclusion in local economics.

As an informal institutional arrangement, the director network is an important source for the enterprise to obtain external information, which provide resource basis for open innovation. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) as the top of management team could make short-sighted decisions for personal interests; this paper also investigates the moderating role of CEO short-sightedness between director network and open innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes 4,102 Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2020 as the research sample. By introducing network centrality and structural hole to measure director network and using data mining to extract key words related to CEO short-sightedness from annual reports, this paper constructs several multiple linear regression models to analyze the impact of director network on open innovation and the moderating role of CEO short-sightedness. Findings: The analysis finds that director network can facilitate corporate open innovation. Enterprises can acquire more external resources in high centrality and structural hole of director network and promote ability for corporate open innovation. The relationship between director network and open innovation is negatively moderated by CEO short-sightedness. When the level of corporate governance and analyst attention is high, the negative effect of CEO short-sightedness on the innovation effect of directors’ networks is suppressed. Originality/value: This is the first empirical paper to investigate the promotion effect of director network on open innovation as well as the negative moderating role of CEO short-sightedness.

Findings: Significant anti-herding is observed in Brazil and Mexico, while Chile and Colombia show results consistent with rational asset pricing models. The COVID-19 pandemic generally intensifies anti-herding trends. Additionally, significant asymmetries in herding/anti-herding effects are noted during different market trends and volatility levels. Furthermore, we identify the drivers of this phenomenon, revealing that extreme crude oil price movements are associated with more pronounced anti-herding, and herding/anti-herding effects appear synchronized across all four markets. Practical implications: Our findings regarding synchronization in herding dynamics suggest challenges in realizing the desired benefits of international diversification in the region. Social implications: The significant cross-country effects indicate that herding dynamics may play a crucial role in precipitating regional financial crises.

Technological investment is even more important for a developing economy to keep pace with or even surpass their more advanced peers in shorter periods.

Using a sample of 30 commercial banks from 2010 to 2022 in Vietnam, the study investigated the drivers for banks’ investment in technology. The results suggested that banks that are larger tended to invest less, while banks with more equity capital also demonstrated less interest in technological investment. Furthermore, there was some evidence in support of the argument that banks innovate to reduce cost, and that profitable banks tend to be engaged in more innovation.

Using data from S&P 100 index stocks and three other datasets containing various financial securities, extensive analyses, including robustness tests, were conducted. Results show that TSMixer outperforms benchmark models in predicting individual stock volatility when applied to datasets with a large number of securities, leveraging its feature-mixing MLP techniques, which can properly model the financial tail dependence phenomenon. However, its superiority diminishes in datasets with fewer securities, such as stock indexes, foreign exchange rates, and commodities, where models like NBEATSx and NHITS often perform better. This indicates that TSMixer's performance is context-dependent, excelling when feature interdependencies can be fully exploited.

Utilizing an event study methodology, the research reveals distinct sectoral responses. The travel and tourism industry consistently experiences negative effects, indicating competitive pressures and a shift in consumer preferences towards alternative accommodations. Conversely, the real estate sector shows positive effects, reflecting new business opportunities in the short-term rental market. Regression analysis highlights the significant influence of macroeconomic variables such as GDP per capita, interest rates, and exchange rates on abnormal returns. The findings suggest that while Airbnb disrupts traditional travel and tourism sectors, it simultaneously stimulates growth in the real estate market. These results underscore the importance of considering both industry-specific dynamics and broader economic conditions when assessing the financial impacts of corporate announcements. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of Airbnb’s role in shaping market dynamics in the Asia Pacific region, offering insights for investors and policymakers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Airbnb Announcements; Asia Pacific Region; C58; G14; Investment Strategies; L83; R33; Real Estate Sector; Travel And Tourism Industry","","","","","Agénor, Pierre Richard, Middle-income growth traps, Research in Economics, 69, 4, pp. 641-660, (2015); Growth Slowdowns and the Middle Income Trap, (2013); Azam, Muhammad, Stock market development and economic growth: Evidences from Asia-4 countries, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 6, 3, pp. 1200-1208, (2016); Journal of Accounting Research, (1968); Sharing Economy and Housing Affordability Evidence from Airbnb, (2018); Barron, Kyle, The effect of home-sharing on house prices and rents: Evidence from Airbnb, Marketing Science, 40, 1, pp. 23-47, (2021); Benítez-Aurioles, Beatriz, What Airbnb does to the housing market, Annals of Tourism Research, 90, (2021); Bianco, Simone, Disruptor Recognition and Market Value of Incumbent Firms: Airbnb and the Lodging Industry, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Research, 48, 1, pp. 84-104, (2024); Boehmer, Ekkehart, Event-study methodology under conditions of event-induced variance, Journal of Financial Economics, 30, 2, pp. 253-272, (1991); Borrego-Domínguez, Susana, Determinants of Tourism Demand in Spain: A European Perspective from 2000–2020, Economies, 10, 11, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","2147429X; 1309422X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205843926"

Analyzing a unique hand-collected dataset of M&A announcements involving Taiwanese acquirers during 2007–2020, we find that acquirers led by elite-educated CEOs are more likely to opt for cash financing in M&A transactions, a preference that persists even after conducting robustness tests and addressing endogeneity bias. Elite-educated CEOs with a Ph.D. or Master's degree in management- or finance-related disciplines are further found to exhibit a marked preference for cash payments, particularly when their firms face greater financial constraints. These observations can be attributed to potentially lower costs of external funding and might also reflect a perception among these CEOs that their firms are undervalued, as posited by both the financing proficiency hypothesis and the overconfidence trait hypothesis. By dissecting distinct implications of these two hypotheses for M&A valuation, we finally examine and show that acquirers led by elite-educated CEOs, particularly those choosing cash for M&A financing, experience superior post-M&A stock returns and operational performance. Our conclusion thus suggests that the financial acumen derived from elite education, rather than overconfidence, predominantly influences M&A payment methods and favorably impacts subsequent valuation outcomes. Overall, this study represents a pioneering effort to shed light on the often-overlooked role of top executives' elite educational backgrounds in strategic decision-making within the context of M&A. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Elite Education; Financial Constraints; Funding Proficiency; M&a; Overconfidence","","","","The author, Xuan-Qi Su, expresses appreciation to the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan for funding this research (Project Code: 113-2410-H-992-009 -).","Abhyankar, Abhay H., Long-run post-merger stock performance of UK acquiring firms: A stochastic dominance perspective, Applied Financial Economics, 15, 10, pp. 679-690, (2005); Agrawal, Anup, The Post‐Merger Performance of Acquiring Firms: A Re‐examination of an Anomaly, Journal of Finance, 47, 4, pp. 1605-1621, (1992); Aktas, Nihat, CEO overconfidence and the value of corporate cash holdings, Journal of Corporate Finance, 54, pp. 85-106, (2019); Financial Constraints and the Method of Payment in Mergers and Acquisitions, (2011); Amano, Yoshiaki, Do acquiring firms achieve their mergers and acquisitions objectives?

Positive media coverage predominantly amplifies these enterprises’ environmental and social performance dimensions, while intriguingly, negative media coverage unexpectedly positively impacts their environmental performance.

Using daily closing prices of 78 companies operating in the Borsa Istanbul Sustainability Index, we constructed correlation, mutual information (both continuous and discrete), and causality (both linear and nonlinear) networks to analyse intercompany relationships. We performed community detection using the Leading Eigenvector and Girvan–Newman methods, which revealed that companies within the same sector, particularly in the financial and manufacturing sectors, tend to form tight-knit communities. These intra-sectoral clusters reflect strong market behaviour correlations driven by sector-specific factors. Additionally, mixed-sector communities highlighted the presence of significant inter-sector dependencies. To assess the impact of ESG scores on these communities, nonparametric tests such as the Kruskal–Wallis, Conover, and log-rank were applied. Results showed that specific ESG factors, including emission, CSR strategy, innovation, and human rights, significantly influenced community formation. For instance, companies with strong performance in emission reduction and CSR strategies were found to form more cohesive communities, emphasizing the role of sustainability in shaping financial networks. Study findings underscore the critical role of ESG factors in financial market dynamics, promoting sustainable investment practices by highlighting the importance of integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions.

Motivation Only a handful of studies have examined the effect of local culture on organizational outcomes. Recent studies shed light on the factors contributing to CSR decoupling, highlighting the value of understanding this disparity; however, few studies have documented the role of societal factors that contribute to this gap. Our study seeks to fill this gap by documenting that corruption culture increases dishonest behavior, reduces social stigma and the likelihood of punishment, promotes managerial rent-seeking, and ultimately affects CSR decoupling. The hypothesis Corruption culture is associated with higher CSR decoupling. Target population We used a sample of Chinese A-listed firms from 2010 to 2020. Adopted methodology We used ordinary least squares, path analysis, two-stage least square (2SLS) regression, generalized method of moment (GMM), and multiperiod difference in difference. Analyses By using 5,428 firm-year observations, this study examined the association between corruption culture and CSR decoupling. We employed robustness and mechanism tests to corroborate the findings and proposed mechanisms. Finally, we conducted heterogeneity tests to assess the varied impact of corporate governance, state ownership, and CEO attributes on the relationship between corruption culture and CSR decoupling. Findings We documented a positive relationship between corruption culture and CSR decoupling. We also found a less pronounced effect of corruption on CSR decoupling among firms with extensive media coverage and investments from qualified foreign institutional investors. Furthermore, the effect of corruption on CSR decoupling was particularly pronounced for private firms. We also observed that the effect of a corruption culture was especially weak for firms with chief executive officers who have international experience, are nonpolitically connected, and are female. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corruption; Csr Decoupling; Institutional Theory","","","","","Adams, Carol A., The ethical, social and environmental reporting-performance portrayal gap, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 17, 5, pp. 731-757, (2004); Agarwal, Anup, Large Shareholders and the Monitoring of Managers: The Case of Antitakeover Charter Amendments, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 25, 2, pp. 143-161, (1990); al-Hadi, Ahmed Khamis, Are corruption and corporate tax avoidance in the United States related?, Review of Accounting Studies, 27, 1, pp. 344-389, (2022); Al-Shammari, Marwan Ahmad, CEO narcissism and corporate social responsibility: Does CEO narcissism affect CSR focus?, Journal of Business Research, 104, pp. 106-117, (2019); Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Capitalizing China, (2012); Arellano, Manuel, Another look at the instrumental variable estimation of error-components models, Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1, pp. 29-51, (1995); Organization Science, (1990); Ballou, Brian, Corporate social responsibility assurance and reporting quality: Evidence from restatements, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 37, 2, pp. 167-188, (2018); Banerji, Sanjay, Political connections, bailout in financial markets and firm value, Journal of Corporate Finance, 50, pp. 388-401, (2018)","","World Scientific","","","","","","22133933; 10944060","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197257205"

The relationship is tested in a sample of 152 non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange over a period from 2003 to 2018. Firms’ financial performance is measured through return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), market-to-book ratio (MBR), and Tobin’s Q (TQ), while boardroom independence is measured through the proportion of non-executive directors on the corporate board. Using the dynamic GMM approach to address the possibility of endogeneity, it was found that boardroom independence is significantly negatively related to the financial performance of the sample firms. This negative impact is due to the reason of close ties of outside independent directors (non-executive directors) with dominant shareholders and management in personal, financial, and social terms. A significant negative influence of the board size and CEO duality on firms’ financial performance was also observed.

Employing a novel time-varying Granger causality approach, we test causality from climate policy uncertainty (CPU) to the index returns of clean energy and nonrenewable energy sectors between November 2009 and December 2021. Our analysis generally reveals a significant causality from CPU to S&P clean energy sector index return throughout the sample period. In contrast, very limited significant causality is observed running from the CPU to the S&P nonrenewable energy index return. This result implies that investments in clean energy firms are affected by the CPU due to the cost of reversing the decisions in uncertain environments. On the other hand, the U.S. newspaper media coverage of climate change has a significant impact not only on the clean energy index returns but also on non-renewable energy index returns, implying an increase in the media coverage regarding climate change influences the awareness of investors on climate change, which affects their trading strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Climate Policy Uncertainty; Non-renewable Energy; Renewable Energy; Time-varying Causality","","","","","Antilla, Liisa, Self-censorship and science: A geographical review of media coverage of climate tipping points, Public Understanding of Science, 19, 2, pp. 240-256, (2010); Atsu, Francis, Energy consumption, finance, and climate change: Does policy uncertainty matter?, Economic Analysis and Policy, 70, pp. 490-501, (2021); Baker, Scott R., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Bank, Matthias, Google search volume and its influence on liquidity and returns of German stocks, Financial Markets and Portfolio Management, 25, 3, pp. 239-264, (2011); Barber, Brad M., All that glitters: The effect of attention and news on the buying behavior of individual and institutional investors, Review of Financial Studies, 21, 2, pp. 785-818, (2008); Estimated Impacts of Climate Policy Risk, (2020); Bartram, Söhnke M., Real effects of climate policy: Financial constraints and spillovers, Journal of Financial Economics, 143, 2, pp. 668-696, (2022); undefined, (2014); Bondia, Ripsy, International crude oil prices and the stock prices of clean energy and technology companies: Evidence from non-linear cointegration tests with unknown structural breaks, Energy, 101, pp. 558-565, (2016); Born, Benjamin, Policy risk and the business cycle, Journal of Monetary Economics, 68, 1, pp. 68-85, (2014)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","26662787","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191778410"

This study pursues the PRISMA method to review selected ETs research and the work of Garrard (Health sciences literature review made easy: the matrix method, Aspen Publication, Gaithersburg, 2004) is applied to construct a SLR matrix to analyze ETs literature in peer-reviewed English publication. A total of 114 articles published in 89 journals between 1992 and 2023 are gathered and evaluated. This study provides four findings. First, the ETs research has been emerged in the previous decades and quantitative method is the dominant research approach. Second, the most-well known set of traits, theories, and measurements of ETs are presented. Third, this study develops a nomological network of ETs which reflects what have been investigated. Finally, this study offers research guidelines which strengthen future research in the field of ETs. These research findings give implications for both theory and practice. In theoretical context, this study provides comprehensive viewpoint of ETs research and creates novel insights for further research, enhancing the extant theories in ETs literature, especially the trait approach to entrepreneurship and the resource-based view theory. In practice, this study facilitates the perceptions of the potential entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, experts, and other stakeholders of the organizations regarding developing an appropriate set of traits for successful entrepreneurs, and the ways to use and improve them probably.

The performance of crypto exchanges is an essential factor in developing crypto assets. Therefore, it is necessary to take adequate measures regarding the reliability, speed, user-friendliness, regulation, and supervision of crypto exchanges. However, each measure to be taken creates extra costs for businesses. Studies are needed to determine the factors that most affect the performance of crypto exchanges. This study develops an integrated framework, i.e., fuzzy best–worst method with the Heronian function—the fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution with the Heronian function (FBWM’H–FMARCOS’H), to evaluate cryptocurrency exchanges. In this framework, the fuzzy best–worst method (FBWM) is used to decide the criteria’s importance, fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution (FMARCOS) is used to prioritize the alternatives, and the Heronian function is used to aggregate the results. Integrating a modified FBWM and FMARCOS with Heronian functions is particularly appealing for group decision-making under vagueness. Through case studies, some well-known cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Türkiye are assessed based on seven critical factors in the cryptocurrency exchange evaluation process. The main contribution of this study is generating new priority strategies to increase the performance of crypto exchanges with a novel decision-making methodology. “Perception of security,” “reputation,” and “commission rate” are found as the foremost factors in choosing an appropriate cryptocurrency exchange for investment. Further, the best score is achieved by Coinbase, followed by Binance. The solidity and flexibility of the methodology are also supported by sensitivity and comparative analyses. The findings may pave the way for investors to take appropriate actions without incurring high costs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Cryptocurrency Exchange Selection; Cryptocurrency Platform; Fuzzy Sets; Investment Decisions; Mcdm","","","","The authors are grateful to the journal's managing-editor-in-chief, Prof. Gang Kou, and the anonymous reviewers for their excellent comments on earlier drafts of this article.","Ajienka, Nemitari, An empirical analysis of source code metrics and smart contract resource consumption, Journal of Software: Evolution and Process, 32, 10, (2020); Amiri, Maghsoud, A new fuzzy BWM approach for evaluating and selecting a sustainable supplier in supply chain management, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, pp. 1-18, (2020); Blockchain Crypto Assets Crypto Assets Und Gamer Tokens Von in Game Items in Game Items Und Non Fungible Tokens Fungible Tokens Nfts Nfts in Games Industry Management Grundung Strategie Und Leadershiptheoretische Grundlagen, (2023); Quick Guide Crypto Assets how They Classify within the Framework of Financial Market Law, (2023); Arias-Oliva, Mario, Variables influencing cryptocurrency use: A technology acceptance model in Spain, Frontiers in Psychology, 10, MAR, (2019); Crypto Exchanges in the Book of Crypto, (2022); Aspris, Angelo, Decentralized exchanges: The “wild west” of cryptocurrency trading, International Review of Financial Analysis, 77, (2021); 2021 Survival of the Fittest A Natural Experiment from Crypto Exchanges Singap Econ Rev 120 Working Paper no 1539; Bianchi, Daniele, Trading volume and liquidity provision in cryptocurrency markets, Journal of Banking and Finance, 142, (2022); Binance Https Www Binance Com En about Accessed 2 Oct 2022","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21994730","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171553815"

It's like trying to read a secret message. We want to figure out what makes investors nervous or happy, because their feelings often affect how they buy and sell stocks. We're building a tool to make prediction that uses both numbers and people's opinions. Design/methodology/approach: Hybrid approach leverages Twitter sentiment, market data, volatility index (VIX) and momentum indicators like moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and relative strength index (RSI) to deliver accurate market insights for informed investment decisions during uncertainty. Findings: Our study reveals that geopolitical tensions' impact on stock markets is fleeting and confined to the short term. Capitalizing on this insight, we built a ground-breaking predictive model with an impressive 98.47% accuracy in forecasting stock market values during such events. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this model's originality lies in its focus on short-term impact, novel data fusion and high accuracy. Focus on short-term impact: Our model uniquely identifies and quantifies the fleeting effects of geopolitical tensions on market behavior, a previously under-researched area. Novel data fusion: Combining sentiment analysis with established market indicators like VIX and momentum offers a comprehensive and dynamic approach to predicting market movements during volatile periods.

In the context of evolving economic policies and the challenges of gender equity affecting Chilean companies, this study explores how economic policy risk (EPU) and CEO characteristics influence working capital, which are essential investments for sustainable growth. The analysis covers 12,839 SMEs from 2014 to 2019. Using a fixed-effects panel data model, the findings reveal that firms tend to increase their investment in working capital in response to rising economic policy uncertainty. However, the relationship follows a non-linear inverted U-shaped pattern, which suggests the existence of an investment optimum between working capital and the EPU. Considering the level of competition, companies increase their investment in working capital when the level of competition is higher. Regarding the gender and age of CEOs, it is observed that women invest less in working capital, as do young CEOs. These results underscore the importance of EPU, along with the gender and age of CEOs, as key factors in promoting sustainable working capital management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chile; Economic Policy Uncertainty (epu); Small And Medium Enterprises (smes); Working Capital Management; Capital Market; Competitiveness; Economic Policy; Gender Disparity; Industrial Investment; Panel Data; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Chile","capital market; competitiveness; economic policy; gender disparity; industrial investment; panel data; small and medium-sized enterprise; Chile","","","","Burgstaller, Johann, How do family ownership and founder management affect capital structure decisions and adjustment of SMEs?: Evidence from a bank-based economy, Journal of Risk Finance, 16, 1, pp. 73-101, (2015); Kumar, Satish, A conceptual framework for identifying financing preferences of SMEs, Small Enterprise Research, 22, 1, pp. 99-112, (2015); Nobanee, Haitham, A bibliometric analysis on working capital management: Current status, development, and future directions, Academy of Strategic Management Journal, 20, SpecialIssue2, pp. 1-13, (2021); Panda, Ajaya Kumar, Working Capital Management, Macroeconomic Impacts, and Firm Profitability: Evidence from Indian SMEs, Business Perspectives and Research, 9, 1, pp. 144-158, (2021); Adam, Anokye M., Working capital management policies and returns of listed manufacturing firms in Ghana, Scientific Annals of Economics and Business, 64, 2, pp. 255-269, (2017); Aktas, Nihat, Is working capital management value-enhancing?

Furthermore, our analysis of economic significance highlights the critical influence of traditional energy-related predictors from G7 and BRICS countries on the global green bond markets. We also find that monetary policies and macroeconomic factors, such as M2 money supply, CPI, and government bond yields, play vital roles. Additionally, the robustness of our proposed method is confirmed. Overall, our study provides a powerful tool that not only significantly enhances forecasting performance but also deepens the understanding of the interplay between trends in green bond markets and information from energy sectors and broader economic conditions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Efficiency; Forecasting; Green Bond; High-dimensional Model; Sustainable Investment","","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72403258), Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (2022JJ40647), the Excellent Young Scholar Project of the Hunan Provincial Department of Education (23B0004), the Innovation and Talent Base for Digital Technology and Finance (B21038), and \u201Cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\u201D, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law (2722024EJ011).","Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Extreme Connectedness between Green Bonds, Government Bonds, Corporate Bonds and Other Asset Classes: Insights for Portfolio Investors, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 15, 10, (2022); Abhilash, Abhilash, A state-of-the-art overview of green bond markets: Evidence from technology empowered systematic literature review, Cogent Economics and Finance, 10, 1, (2022); Ahmed, Razin, Computationally expedient Photovoltaic power Forecasting: A LSTM ensemble method augmented with adaptive weighting and data segmentation technique, Energy Conversion and Management, 258, (2022); Arlot, Sylvain, A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection, Statistics Surveys, 4, pp. 40-79, (2010); Audrino, Francesco, Lassoing the HAR Model: A Model Selection Perspective on Realized Volatility Dynamics, Econometric Reviews, 35, 8-10, pp. 1485-1521, (2016); Baltas, Konstantinos N., What drives the performance and causality of green bond indices?, European Journal of Finance, 30, 3, pp. 269-287, (2024); Baumeister, Christiane, A comparison of monthly global indicators for forecasting growth, International Journal of Forecasting, 37, 3, pp. 1276-1295, (2021); Braco, Elisa, Fast capacity and internal resistance estimation method for second-life batteries from electric vehicles, Applied Energy, 329, (2023); Broadstock, David C., Time-varying relation between black and green bond price benchmarks: Macroeconomic determinants for the first decade, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 17-22, (2019); Browne, Michael W., Cross-validation methods, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 44, 1, pp. 108-132, (2000)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","10575219","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206793875"

Our results reveal that investor-firm interaction can significantly reduce the ESG rating divergence, and this result remains robust after robustness tests. The mechanism test suggests that interactions related to ESG theme can improve the ESG disclosure quality and increase ESG practices; this leads to reduced information asymmetry, thus easing rating divergence. Further, the effect is more pronounced when listed companies' ESG disclosures are similar to those in their industry, non-centralized enterprises, low corporate governance level, and fewer green investors.

Arguments based on human relations theory suggest that satisfied employees are likely to be motived to exert greater efforts and exhibit lower turnover, thereby reducing employer's exposure to labour market frictions. In contrast, agency theory argues that satisfied employees may become entrenched and thus harm organisational outcomes, including CLIE. We measure satisfaction with employers across our sample companies using 164,341 employees' ratings posted on Glassdoor UK. We observe a positive impact of employee satisfaction on CLIE, demonstrating the validity of underlying human relations theory for the present business context characterised by labour shortages. We also find the positive impact of employee satisfaction on CLIE to be stronger for companies with higher labour intensity, more reliance on skilled labour, and more competitive industry environments. Our study contributes to research investigating the determinants of efficient investment in workforce. We also demonstrate the informational value of employee' online reviews for understanding a company's performance, particularly in assessing the efficiency of its employment decisions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Employee Retention; Employee Satisfaction; Labour Investment Efficiency; Labour Shortages","","","","Funding text 1: This research has been funded by the Leverhulme Trust Grant \u2018 Understanding workplace democracy through corporate and employee disclosures \u2019 ( RPG-2022-098 ).; Funding text 2: This research has been funded by the Leverhulme Trust Grant \u2018Understanding workplace democracy through corporate and employee disclosures\u2019 (RPG-2022-098).We are grateful to the Leverhulme Trust for funding this research project.

Thus, our rigorous empirical analysis reveals that media visibility significantly affects corporate environmental sustainability efforts, with formal and informal environmental regulations moderating its impact. Media attention acts as a powerful catalyst for green innovation during growth and mature stages of a company's lifecycle; however, its effect diminishes during recessions. We determine significant heterogeneity across industry types and ownership structures. Non-high-polluting industries and non-state-owned enterprises show stronger positive responses to media scrutiny in their green innovation efforts than high-polluting sectors and state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, formal environmental regulations amplify the positive effect of media attention on green innovation, suggesting a synergistic potential that encourages companies to exceed baseline environmental standards. In contrast, while having no direct impact on green innovation, informal environmental regulation significantly moderates the relationship between media attention and innovation quality. These findings add to the literature on environmental innovation by demonstrating the conditional effectiveness of media attention and the critical role of regulatory frameworks in fostering sustainable corporate practices across industries and ownership contexts, with implications for policymakers, corporate strategists, and environmental advocates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Green Innovation; Corporate Sustainability; Environmental Regulation; Media Attention","","","","This study is supported by Guangdong Ocean University Research Start-up Fund Project \u201CThe Impact of FDI on China's Industrial Green Transformation\u201D(Grant No. 060302092103 ).","Bai, Caiquan, Blessing or curse?

The speed and complexity with which new financial technologies have spread around the world have created regulatory challenges for the United States and Canadian authorities. Unlike the United States, where there is regulatory fragmentation and a supervisory instrument with regulatory relief, Canada has a more integrated regulatory approach managed by regulatory sandbox principles. The aim of this article is to study and compare the impact of FinTech adoption on commercial banks over the 2018–2023 period in the United States and Canadian FinTech ecosystems. The results essentially show that FinTech has a positive impact on commercial banks' performance and financial growth, and a negative impact on liquidity and financial risk. Our results present several contributions and mainly show that: (1) In the presence of multiple entry channels for FinTech startups, the impact of FinTech on financial performance is higher in the United States than in Canada. (2) Because of its regulatory approach, Canada lags behind the United States in the adoption rate of financial technologies. (3) Balance of power in the financial sector induces commercial banks not to consider FinTech startups as threats but rather as partners that offer opportunities for expertise and reduced regulatory costs. Finally, FinTech can be disruptive and presents many challenges for regulators given the complexity and speed of innovation it promotes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fintech; Growth; Liquidity; Performance; Regulatory Sandboxes; Risk","","","","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding their work through the Research Small Group Project under grant number RGP1/157/45.","Journal of Marketing, (1990); Abdul-Rahim, Ruzita, Benefit–Risk Perceptions of FinTech Adoption for Sustainability from Bank Consumers’ Perspective: The Moderating Role of Fear of COVID-19, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022); Abraham, Rene, Data governance: A conceptual framework, structured review, and research agenda, International Journal of Information Management, 49, pp. 424-438, (2019); Adusei, Michael, Does Entrepreneurship Promote Economic Growth in Africa?, African Development Review, 28, 2, pp. 201-214, (2016); Akhtar, Quratulain, The impact of fintech and banks M&A on Acquirer's performance: A strategic win or loss?, Borsa Istanbul Review, 22, 6, pp. 1195-1208, (2022); Ali, Syaiful, Determining Factors of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Avoidance: Empirical Evidence from Indonesia, Gadjah Mada International Journal of Business, 25, 1, pp. 1-27, (2023); Alkhazaleh, Ayman Mansour Khalaf, How does the Fintech services delivery affect customer satisfaction: A scenario of Jordanian banking sector, Strategic Change, 30, 4, pp. 405-413, (2021); Al-Okaily, Manaf, The role of digital accounting transformation in the banking industry sector: an integrated model, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 22, 2, pp. 308-326, (2024); Al-Shari, Hussein Ahmed, The relationship between the risks of adopting FinTech in banks and their impact on the performance, Cogent Business and Management, 10, 1, (2023); Alsmadi, Ayman Abdalmajeed, Impact of business enablers on banking performance: A moderating role of Fintech, Banks and Bank Systems, 18, 1, pp. 14-25, (2023)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","10964762","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201051039"

In this paper, we constructed the one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models to investigate the feasibility of forecasting corporate financial performance with deep learning models, using the corporate financial features and environment, social and governance (ESG) rating index of Chinese A-share listed corporation data from 2015 to 2021. Five evaluation metrics were employed to measure models' forecasting effects, and four competing machine learning models were built to verify the improvement in forecasting accuracy brought by the deep learning models. Furthermore, we also introduced the Accumulated Local Effects method to explore the forecasting processes of the deep learning models. The empirical results show the following: (1) Deep learning models can effectively extract the time-series information in corporate data, thereby solving the task of predicting corporate financial performance with high accuracy. (2) The introduction of ESG information significantly contributes to the forecasting accuracy of corporate financial performance.

We reveal that NPO significantly inhibits ESG ratings. The heterogeneity of the semantic bias of NPO does not alter this adverse effect. The negative relationship between these two factors is exacerbated by the level of managers' occupational anxiety. Media attention and analyst coverage can mitigate these adverse effects. However, media attention fails to reduce the inhibitory impact of negative NPO (NNPO) on ESG ratings. The inhibitory impact of NPO on ESG ratings is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs).

This study employs the dynamic system Generalized Method of Moments to analyze an unbalanced sample of 1,990 firm-year observations from 2010 to 2019. The results indicate that larger firm size increases the Z-score index, implying that larger firms have lower bankruptcy risk. Our finding also reports that financial constraints reduce the Z-score index, suggesting that financially constrained firms have extremely high bankruptcy risk. Our findings also show the inverted U-shape relationship between financial constraints and distress risk. Our results support the too-big-to-fall theory, the trade-off theory, the agency theory, and prior literature.

By conducting research across four major databases, we performed a thematic analysis that identified four principal themes: Benefits and Impacts, GLI Strategies, GLI Instruments and Innovations, and Challenges and Barriers to Implementation. Key findings reveal an increased implementation of GLI in various forms and a gradual increase in publications, reflecting growing interest within academia and industry. Despite these advancements, critical gaps remain in understanding the financial and social impacts of GLI strategies and instruments. While GLI has been broadly defined and implemented, further empirical research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of GLI in public equities and its long-term impacts.

Moreover, this study investigates the connection between BuPE and Environmental Sustainability (ESG), as determined by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach: Econometric methods, such as feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) regression, and random effects, ordinary least squares (OLS), are applied to investigate the connection between the independent and dependent variables, utilizing a sample of 131 Saudi listed firms spanning from 2015 to 2021. Findings: Regression analysis shows that the size and independence of audit committees have a positive impact on BuPE, while audit committee meetings are negatively linked to BuPE. The outcomes also indicate that audit committee commitment was not affected by BuPE. Moreover, ESG has a positive and significant relationship with BuPE. On the same path, the results of the additional analysis confirm the main results. Practical implications: The findings of this study may serve as a valuable basis for regulatory actions, particularly with respect to audit committees and CSR. These findings have far-reaching implications for regulators and investors, as they offer valuable insights into the effects of CSR and audit committee features on BuPE. Originality/value: The current research demonstrates that audit committees and CSR have distinct implications for firms’ BuPE, as evidenced by empirical data. The findings suggest that policymakers and researchers should not view CSR as a homogenous concept, as it has varying effects on firms’ BuPE. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audit Committees’ Characteristics; Business Performance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Environmental Sustainability; Action Plan; Business; Corporate Social Responsibility; Governance Approach; Independence; Performance Assessment; Regression Analysis; Sustainability; Arabian Peninsula; Saudi Arabia","action plan; business; corporate social responsibility; governance approach; independence; performance assessment; regression analysis; sustainability; Arabian Peninsula; Saudi Arabia","","","Funding text 1: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Jouf University for funding this work through a large-group Research Project under grant number (DSR2023-04-02391).; Funding text 2: This work was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Jouf University under contract no.

Many governments have tried to issue a batch of transformation and upgrading (TFU) policies with the hope of guiding traditional enterprises’ smooth change. However, there is a dearth of systematic research on the long-term effects of TFU policies, which is not conducive to improving those policies. This paper aims to study what TFU policies generate to concerned traditional energy enterprises in the long run from a perspective of capital asset pricing. Taking China’s coal-fired power generation industry, the typical and the largest traditional energy industry, as the sample, 318 TFU policies issued by the Chinese government and the relevant data of A-share listed coal and thermal power enterprises in the industry were collected. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation model was employed to categorize the TFU policies into six types, and then the Jensen alpha model was built to test the long-term effects of each type of TFU policy at varying lagged periods. The results show that under all the types of TFU policies, the Jensen alpha values of both coal and thermal power stock portfolios are significantly negative at each lagged period, implying negative long-term effects. Further statistical analysis shows that the Jensen alpha values of central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are stochastically larger than those of local SOEs under most types of TFU policies, indicating that central SOEs are generally less negatively affected. Moreover, the varying characteristics of the Jensen alpha values between coal and thermal power portfolios and between central and local SOEs were discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coal-fired Power Generation Industry; Jensen Alpha; Long-term Effects; Market Performance; Transformation And Upgrading Policy; Coal-fired Power Plant; Energy Market; Orientation; Power Generation; Statistical Analysis; Sustainable Development; Thermal Power; China","coal-fired power plant; energy market; orientation; power generation; statistical analysis; sustainable development; thermal power; China","","","This work was supported by the Yueqi Young Scholars Fund of China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing [grant number 800015Z11A21]; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 590121047].","Ang, James S., Evaluating long-horizon event study methodology, pp. 383-411, (2015); Antimiani, Alessandro, Fossil fuels subsidy removal and the EU carbon neutrality policy, Energy Economics, 119, (2023); Bensouda, Mehdi, Overcoming Risk Aversion Regarding Energy Efficiency Practices through Mimetic Pressure and Financial Slack: Findings from the Moroccan Manufacturing Sector, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 23, (2022); Blackman, Allen, Efficacy of Command-and-Control and Market-Based Environmental Regulation in Developing Countries, Annual Review of Resource Economics, 10, pp. 381-404, (2018); Bongini, Paola Agnese, The importance of being systemically important financial institutions, Journal of Banking and Finance, 50, pp. 562-574, (2015); Brauers, Hanna, Comparing coal phase-out pathways: The United Kingdom's and Germany's diverging transitions, Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions, 37, pp. 238-253, (2020); Breloer, Bernhard J., Jensen alpha and market climate, Journal of Asset Management, 17, 3, pp. 195-214, (2016); Bromley-Trujillo, Rebecca, The Spreading of Innovation: State Adoptions of Energy and Climate Change Policy, Review of Policy Research, 33, 5, pp. 544-565, (2016); Carroll, Deborah Allen, The short-term impact on emissions and federal tax revenue of a carbon tax in the U.S. electricity sector, Energy Policy, 158, (2021); Chen, Shan, The current situation, development aims and policy recommendation of China’s electric power industry, International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management, 15, 2, pp. 282-299, (2023)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","15731596; 13812386","","MASCF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202705067"

However, there is limited research on whether corporate motivations to engage in ESG activities affect stock liquidity. We examine this relationship in the context of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by studying the role of three motivations (strategic, altruism, or greenwashing) for company engagement in ESG activities in explaining stock liquidity. We also examine the role of sustainability committees in explaining stock liquidity. Using companies included in the S&P ASX 300 from 2009 to 2018, a positive association is found between stock liquidity and a strategic motivation for environmental and social engagement and sustainability committee presence. An unexpected finding is that sustainability committee formation can mislead investors to reward a greenwashing motivation by improving stock liquidity. These findings provide valuable new insights into motives to engage particularly with the “E” and “S” in ESG and sustainability committees' role in improving stock liquidity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Es Motivation; Stock Liquidity; Sustainability Committee","","","","We gratefully acknowledge insightful comments from the Social and Environmental Sustainability in Organisations Research Group, Swinburne University of Technology, Dr. Maria Balabat (University of New South Wales) and thank participants at the July 2022 AFAANZ conference (Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand) held in Melbourne, Australia.","Ali, Searat, What determines stock liquidity in Australia?, Applied Economics, 48, 35, pp. 3329-3344, (2016); Ali, Searat, Corporate governance and stock liquidity dimensions: Panel evidence from pure order-driven Australian market, International Review of Economics and Finance, 50, pp. 275-304, (2017); Alsaadi, Abdullah M., Corporate Social Responsibility, Shariah-Compliance, and Earnings Quality, Journal of Financial Services Research, 51, 2, pp. 169-194, (2017); Amihud, Yakov, Illiquidity and stock returns: Cross-section and time-series effects, Journal of Financial Markets, 5, 1, pp. 31-56, (2002); Andreoni, James, Avoiding the ask: A field experiment on altruism, empathy, and charitable giving, Journal of Political Economy, 125, 3, pp. 625-653, (2017); Beck, Cornelia, CSR disclosure and financial performance revisited: A cross-country analysis, Australian Journal of Management, 43, 4, pp. 517-537, (2018); Journal of Political Economy, (1974); Bénabou, Roland, Individual and corporate social responsibility, Economica, 77, 305, pp. 1-19, (2010); Zarzadzanie Publiczne, (2012); Ben-Rephael, Azi, The Diminishing Liquidity Premium, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 50, 1-2, pp. 197-229, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","0927538X","","PBFJE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202539013"

Investments in assets related to ESG have recently grown, attracting interest from both academic research and investment fund practice. Various literature strands in this area address the theoretical and empirical relation among return, risk and ESG. Our portfolio optimization approach is flexible enough to take these literature strands into account and does not require large-scale covariance matrix estimation. An extension of our approach even allows investors to empirically discriminate among the literature strands.

Results reveal that technological diversity, as a people-independent intangible resource, positively affects firm resilience. This effect is achieved through the mediating effects of product, customer, and market diversity. Meanwhile, as people-dependent intangible resources, managerial ability positively moderates the relationship between technological diversity and firm resilience, whereas political connections negatively moderate the relationship between technological diversity and firm resilience.

The authors employed a panel data study of a sample of 75 listed companies, i.e. 225 firm-year observations, covering financial years from 2019 to 2022. The research concluded that integrated reporting quality, measured by the Pistoni Scoreboard, positively impacts a firm's value over the years, and the characteristics of that firm, i.e. size and age, also moderate the relationship between both the variables. This scoreboard was chosen as it assigns numerical values to the quality of information presented, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions. This paper motivates managers to produce high-quality integrated reports as they positively influence the firm's value, which could result in the company's movement in a more profitable direction. The paper also offers significant insights for investors motivated to invest in companies that publish integrated reports.

Stakeholder theory asserts that environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance forces enterprises to prioritise stakeholder needs by incorporating ESG principles into business operations, which in turn influences business investment decision-making. This study examines the impact of government subsidies on firm underinvestment and whether ESG performance plays a moderating role in this direct relationship. A dataset of 17,780 firm-year observations of A-share public firms in China for the period 2011–2021 was employed, and the data were analysed using the ordinary least squares regression model, fixed-effects regression model, propensity score matching difference-in-difference model, and instrumental variable approach. These results indicate that government subsidies mitigate firm underinvestment and tend to reduce underinvestment in firms with higher ESG performance. Moreover, the findings indicate that the performance in ESG factors influences the effect of government subsidies on the lack of investment in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), as opposed to non-SOEs. This effect is more noticeable in heavily polluting industries compared to non-heavily polluting industries. These findings imply that the government should promote the ESG performance of subsidised firms to enhance their overall corporate investment efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Esg Performance; Government Subsidy; Heavily Polluting Industries; Underinvestment","","","","","Li, Kaifeng, Environmental uncertainty, financing constraints and corporate investment: Evidence from China, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 70, (2021); Deng, Kebin, Staged subsidies and corporate investments: Evidence from Chinese listed firms, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 68, (2021); Hu, Jinshuai, Government subsidies and corporate investment efficiency: Evidence from China, Emerging Markets Review, 41, (2019); Luo, Xingwu, Government subsidies and firm performance: Evidence from high-tech start-ups in China, Emerging Markets Review, 49, (2021); Jiang, Jie, COVID-19 impact on firm investment—Evidence from Chinese publicly listed firms, Journal of Asian Economics, 75, (2021); Li, Qi, Financial constraints, government subsidies, and corporate innovation, PLOS ONE, 16, 11 November, (2021); Yang, Zhonghai, Monetary policy tightening, accounting information comparability, and underinvestment: Evidence from China, Economic Analysis and Policy, 70, pp. 123-147, (2021); Gao, Xin, Media coverage and investment efficiency, Journal of Empirical Finance, 63, pp. 270-293, (2021); Ho, Kungcheng, How does corporate social performance affect investment inefficiency?

The study used yearly data on the Pakistani IPO market and the macroeconomic variables from January 1992 to December 2020. Further, the study employed the linear and Non-Linear ARDL to investigate the symmetric and asymmetric nexus among variables. For that purpose, the stationarity of the variables was predetermined using Augmented Dicker Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) unit root tests. Additionally, the F-bound test verifies that IPO issuance and macroeconomic drivers are co-integrated. The findings show a symmetric and asymmetric relationship between IPO variability and macroeconomic variables under study. Renewable energy and technological innovation have statistically positive effects on IPO variability. On the contrary, the ecological footprint has a significantly negative impact on IPO variability. The weak condition of the Pakistani IPO market could be attributed to the slow adoption of technological innovation, the transition to renewable energy, and a high ecological footprint that attracts stringent regulatory and environmental compliance costs of going public. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ecological Footprint; Ipo Variability; Pakistan Stock Exchange; Renewable Energy; Technological Innovation","","","","","Ahmad, Manzoor, Does financial development asymmetrically affect CO2 emissions in China?

This article analyses the traditional Chief Executive Officer (CEO)-to-employee pay ratio but includes a new relation, the senior-management-to-employee pay ratio, and extends the research by including six positions for women in company management: on the board of directors, executive directors, CEOs, proprietary directors, independent directors, and senior managers. The study is based on a sample of 77 listed companies in Spain from 2015 to 2022 and the panel data models have been estimated using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM). The main findings indicate that the proportion of women in different categories of board and senior management positions has a positive effect on the CEO-to-employee pay ratio, especially in companies with higher market capitalisation. In contrast, the proportion of women in senior management positions has a negative effect on the CEO-to-employee pay ratio in all the samples analysed. Government agencies should prioritise the participation of women in non-board senior management positions in order to at least reduce the pay gap between senior managers and employees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo–employee Pay Ratio; Senior Management–employee Pay Ratio; Spanish Listed Companies; Women On Boards","","","","","Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Adams, Susan M., Gender differences in CEO compensation: Evidence from the USA, Women in Management Review, 22, 3, pp. 208-224, (2007); Ahmed, Ammad, Boardroom gender diversity and CEO pay deviation: Australian evidence, Accounting and Finance, 61, 2, pp. 3135-3170, (2021); Akerlof, George A., The fair wage-effort hypothesis and unemployment, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 105, 2, pp. 255-283, (1990); Alan, Nazli Sila, CEO-to-employee pay ratio and CEO diversity, Managerial Finance, 47, 3, pp. 356-382, (2021); Al-Najjar, Basil, Corporate governance and CEO pay: Evidence from UK Travel and Leisure listed firms, Tourism Management, 60, pp. 9-14, (2017); Amihud, Yakov, Corporate Control and the Choice of Investment Financing: The Case of Corporate Acquisitions, Journal of Finance, 45, 2, pp. 603-616, (1990); Journal of Corporation Law, (2021); Arellano, Manuel, Another look at the instrumental variable estimation of error-components models, Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1, pp. 29-51, (1995); Arellano, Manuel, Some tests of specification for panel data:monte carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277072","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205042058"

The findings reveal that large shareholders' stock selling has a significant negative impact on corporate performance, primarily manifested through two paths that are intensifying agency conflicts and increasing financing constraints. Moreover, the negative effect is more pronounced in enterprises with more intense product market competition, non-state-owned enterprises, enterprises with lower ownership concentration, and those with higher equity balance degree. Further analysis confirms that cash dividends significantly mitigate the negative impact of large shareholders' stock selling on corporate performance, while share pledging significantly exacerbates the negative effect. Our findings suggest that governments should regulate the stock selling of large shareholders based on internal and external enterprise environments, while international investors should consider market information such as stock selling, dividends and pledging when optimizing their investment allocations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Conflicts; Cash Dividends; Financing Constraints; Large Shareholders' Stock Selling; Share Pledging","","","","The work was supported in part by National Social Science Fund of China (22&ZD120), CMA Key Open Laboratory of Transforming Climate Resources to Economy (No. 2024005K) and Shanghai Philosophy and Social Sciences Project (No. 2021ZJB004).","Eur J Dev Res, (2024); An, Can, How Does Corporate Governance Affect Loan Collateral?

Design/methodology/approach: To test the predictions, 13,942 firm-year observations from 43 different countries are used, covering the period from 2010 to 2019. Using a hand-mapping approach to match the indicators suggested by the SASB with those of the ASSET4, the authors realize that there are 170 material sustainability indicators among 466 indicators of the ASSET4. The authors use three different methods to verify if the materiality matters, including the alphas obtained from the Fama and French factor models, comparing the average abnormal returns of the portfolios and the bootstrapped Cramer technique. Findings: The findings show that companies investing in material sustainability activities perform better than those investing in immaterial activities. Also, consistent with the theoretical foundations, the authors find that the effect of investing in material sustainability activities is more pronounced in stakeholder-oriented countries than that in shareholder-oriented countries. The results are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests. Research limitations/implications: Owing to COVID-19 in late 2019, data from 2020 to 2022 have not been used to obtain reliable results. Practical implications: The results obtained in the current research provide valuable guidance for investors to make investments considering the degree of materiality of sustainability activities in different industries. It also helps managers to increase the company’s financial performance, make efficient decisions related to investment in sustainability activities and find investment strategies on the material sustainability issues in their industries. Social implications: This study provides a clearer understanding of investment in sustainability activities in different industries by separating material and immaterial sustainability activities in stakeholder and shareholder-oriented countries, and the results obtained can change the perspective of investors and company managers regarding investing in such activities in different countries. Investing in more materiality sustainability activities than the immateriality dimension can be new opportunities for companies to achieve predetermined goals, help retain and attract business partners or be a source of innovation for new product lines or services. Internal morale and employee engagement may increase while increasing productivity and firm performance. This discussion opens the way for future research. Originality/value: This study provides insight into the effect of investing in material and immaterial sustainability activities in different industries on the company’s performance in shareholder and stakeholder-oriented countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Sustainability Investment; Financial Performance; Material And Immaterial Sustainability; Stakeholders Orientation","","","","","Aguinis, Herman, Understanding employee responses to COVID-19: a behavioral corporate social responsibility perspective, Management Research, 18, 4, pp. 421-438, (2020); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2022); Ali Fekrat, M., Corporate environmental disclosures: Competitive disclosure hypothesis using 1991 annual report data, International Journal of Accounting, 31, 2, pp. 175-195, (1996); Stakeholder Capitalism Corporate Governance and Firm Value, (2007); Arrive, Tsitaire Jean, Corporate social responsibility disclosure: Evidence from BRICS nations, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 25, 5, pp. 920-927, (2018); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1988); Badía, Guillermo, Are investments in material corporate social responsibility issues a key driver of financial performance?, Accounting and Finance, 62, 3, pp. 3987-4011, (2022); Ben-Amar, Walid, What drives voluntary corporate water disclosures?

It also investigates whether powerful CEOs using a “CEO score index” moderate IO and firm performance nexus by drawing on insights from the agency and resource dependency theories. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from annual reports of companies listed on the Palestine Security Exchange from 2009 to 2019. Panel data regressions were conducted based on 528 observations. In addition, this study repeated the analysis using a one-step generalized method of moments (GMM) and two-stage least squares analysis to deal with the endogeneity issue. Findings: Results show that IO and CEO power is positively associated with firm performance. Besides, it has been established that CEO power strengthens the relationship between IO and performance. Thus, this can be summarized that IO improves firm performance; however, with the powerful CEO intervention, the performance will improve even more. Originality/value: Studying IO is timely given since the type of ownership is paramount to identify which form of a high degree of ownership affects the performance negatively, especially, in the Palestine environment which is dominated by institutional investors. This is of great importance to the investors as it will enable them to identify the type of firms to which they can commit their funds, and which firm excels through the CEO power. Besides, the inconsistency results in previous literature on IO, and firm performance indicates that there is an indirect effect that needs alternative explanations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Power; Ceo Score Index; Firm Performance; Institutional Ownership; Palestine Security Exchange","","","","The authors are thankful to Palestine Technical University- Khadoorie for its support.","Scinzer Journal of Accounting and Management, (2017); Acabado, Daniela Rodrigues, Do Distinct CSR Categories have Distinct Determinants?

Some empirical studies have shown that air pollution, as part of environmental change, affects stock market investment; however, the mechanisms by which air pollution affects investment in green assets have not been explored in depth. This study investigates the impact of air pollution on green stocks through investor sentiment and green preference. Our empirical analysis reveals that declining air quality prompts negative investor sentiment, exerting an adverse impact on the stock market. Conversely, green preference exerts a positive influence on green stocks, with the magnitude of this effect being contingent on the degree of greenness (i.e., depth and breadth) of the stocks. Companies with a high degree of greenness experience a significant positive correlation between air pollution and stock prices, whereas this relationship is not significant for companies with lower greenness.

Our empirical analysis discloses multiple imperative findings. First, the period of high dependence between oil and these DJSI assets applies only at higher frequency (128–256 days). As such, DJSI Europe, US, Asia-Pacific, and Korea show the strongest dependence with oil in the long run. However, this inter-relationship is only visible from 2018 onwards. Second, the link between DJSI indices and gold is minimal across the dependency spectrum and at multiple frequencies. Third, when comparing a benchmark portfolio with a blended portfolio composed of a suitability index with gold/oil, in consistency with the hedging ratios results, the utility gain is remarkably better in the sustainability/gold pairing.

Also, it develops a research framework and assesses the mediating role of brand image, brand love, brand reputation and brand trust between customer perceptions of CC and customer loyalty. Design/methodology/approach: Working with a sample of 290 private bank customers in Iran, partial least square-based structural equation modeling is used to test the conceptual model. Findings: The findings reveal significant and positive relationships between CC, brand image, love and reputation. Indirectly and in the relationship between CC and customer loyalty, there are significant relationships through the serial roles of image-reputation, image-love and image-trust. Most importantly, the findings add value to the current knowledge by exploring the mediating effect of brand image, love, reputation and trust between CC and customer loyalty. Finally, this study has resulted in an updated prediction model of private banking customer loyalty.

Legal initiatives to address the effects of this crime have not kept pace with the development of FinTech. Therefore, this research aims to form innovative, effective and efficient concepts and approaches to combat financial crimes that use digital technology as a tool to commit crimes. Method: This study uses descriptive qualitative methods and literature studies using financial crime investigation techniques to trace money is a valid theory. This method tracks assets for illicit earnings through forensic accounting and investigative auditing. But in order to implement this strategy, the legal system's core principles must be changed from emphasizing evidence of guilt to emphasizing evidence of the consequences of crime. Result: According to this article, Islamic law enforcement officials and other relevant parties require a system of coordination that is both harmonic and synergistic from a structural standpoint. In the meanwhile, community economic infrastructure needs to be developed in terms of legal culture, particularly business transactions that facilitate data-based systems. Conclusion: Islamic law enforcement strategies against financial crimes, especially Financial Technology (Fintech), must be developed in a complete legal system both in terms of legal substance, legal structure and legal culture. Development of legal substance is carried out through changes to regulations that accommodate advances in financial crimes and financial technology crimes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Financial Fraud; Financial Technology; Islamic Law","","","","","Aksoy, Tamer, Relationship Between Fraud Auditing and Forensic Accounting, Contributions to Finance and Accounting, Part F213, pp. 127-146, (2021); Alaeddin, Omar, Implementing the Blockchain Technology in Islamic Financial Industry: Opportunities and Challenges, Journal of Information Technology Management, 13, 3, pp. 99-115, (2021); Fintech Syariah Indonesia Naik Ke Peringkat 3 Global, (2022); Baker, Lori, Dubai international financial centre’s updated data protection law-part 1: Developing a modern, global law in a uae fnancial free zone, Journal of Data Protection and Privacy, 3, 2, pp. 161-171, (2020); Bartlett, Robert P., Consumer-lending discrimination in the FinTech Era, Journal of Financial Economics, 143, 1, pp. 30-56, (2022); Blanco, Belen, Financial statement comparability and accounting fraud, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 50, 7-8, pp. 1166-1205, (2023); Frimpong Boamah, Emmanuel, “Techno-market fix”?

We use a broad international sample of 1,048 green bonds issued between 2013 and 2022 by 200 entities from 26 countries. Our analysis reveals a significant, though not uniform, reaction in the CDSs. The sector of activity emerges as a critical determinant, particularly with respect to environmental exposure. While sectors highly exposed to environmental risk exhibit a reduction in issuer credit risk, all others, especially financial entities, react in the opposite direction. Our study highlights that the impact on credit risk is influenced by several other factors, including the issuer's overall ESG score, its E score, and various country-level metrics such as development level, environmental performance and political rights. We also identify other factors that affect credit risk, such as green bond ratings and operating cash flow. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cds Spreads; Credit Risk; Event Study; Green Bonds; Sustainable Finance","","","","Laura Ballester and Ana Gonzalez-Urteaga acknowledge financial support from Fundaci\u00F3n Ram\u00F3n Areces and Grant TED2021-131216B-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by \u201CEuropean Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR\u201D.

The findings reveal an inverted U-shape between CEO power and CSR within family businesses; meanwhile, investor attention demonstrates a negative impact on CSR. Moreover, the results report that CEO power is a moderating factor in the relationship between investor attention and CSR. These results are consistent with various theoretical frameworks, including agency theory, overinvestment, career concern, career horizon, and conflict-resolution hypotheses.

The mechanism analysis shows managerial climate attention can reduce carbon emissions by promoting corporate green innovation.

Firms tend to mitigate the legitimacy pressures exerted by stakeholders in a variety of ways in order to improve their corporate image. At the same time, environmental legitimacy is a strategic resource for enterprises, helping them to obtain external support, which provides space for the emergence of corporate \u201Cgreenwashing\u201D behavior. Corporate \u201Cgreenwashing\u201D refers to the selective release of environmental information or the strategic presentation of environmental issues to create a green image. In order to conform to societal expectations of corporate behavior, firms may use disclosure to greenwashing and obfuscate poor environmental governance performance (Michelon et al., 2019; Patten, 2002). Cho et al. (2012) found that environmental underperformers are more likely to voluntarily disclose non-financial information to legitimize their underperformance. In addition, firms disclose soft and non-quantifiable information to explain their carbon emission initiatives (Garcia-Meca & Sanchez-Ballesta, 2010) or manipulate or hide their potential carbon emissions (De Villiers & Van Staden, 2006). Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether corporate disclosures are managers' environmental awareness and thoughts or a deliberate means of focusing on the effects of emission reductions to gain stakeholder support. Thus, research on the effect of managerial climate attention (MCA) on carbon emissions (CE) needs to be supported by sufficient empirical evidence.","Abramova, Inna, Institutional investor attention and firm disclosure, Accounting Review, 95, 6, pp. 1-21, (2020); Afrifa, Godfred A., Innovation input, governance and climate change: Evidence from emerging countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 161, (2020); Alam, Ahmed W., Geopolitical risk, CEO power, and corporate lobbying: Do powerful CEOs lobby more?, Finance Research Letters, 62, (2024); Alessi, Lucia, What greenium matters in the stock market?

We use the wavelet conditional value-at-risk ratio to explore the benefits of adding green assets to conventional portfolios. We quantify risk based on the contagion between conventional stock market indices and green environmental assets, including a sustainability index, clean energy, and green bonds. Our findings emphasize the high variance between conventional stock pairs, providing evidence of contagion effects before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that including clean energy and green bond indices in conventional portfolios reduces the extreme risk of portfolios. In addition, we find that the diversification benefits of clean energy, green bonds, and safe-haven investments apply especially in the short term during the pandemic.

This research examines the relationship between the managers capabilities and their ability to achieve high ESG performance, particularly in challenging and restricting financial environments. This research also uncovers the process through which competent managers reduce the financial restrictions of businesses. Panel regressions are estimated on a dataset of 6294 firm years of Chinese listed companies from 2010 to 2019. Our study findings demonstrate that chief executive officers (CEOs) with strong management skills exhibit a positive correlation with their company's ESG performance and its subcomponents. Moreover, financial constraints exert a negative moderating effect on the relationship between CEO management competence and ESG performance. Specifically, competent CEOs of financially constrained organizations prioritize ESG performance more significantly than their counterparts in companies without financial limitations. The findings are robust to various estimating methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Aghion, Philippe, Credit constraints as a barrier to the entry and post-entry growth of firms, Economic Policy, 22, 52, pp. 731-779, (2007); Managers Career Concerns and Asymmetric Disclosure of Bad Versus Good News, (2015); Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Arellano, Manuel, Another look at the instrumental variable estimation of error-components models, Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1, pp. 29-51, (1995); Instrumental Variables and GMM: Estimation and Testing, 3, 1, pp. 1-31; American Economic Association Agency Costs Net Worth and Business Fluctuations Author S Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler Source the American Economic Review Vol 79 no 1 Mar 1989 Pp 1431 Published by American Economic Associati American Economic Review 79 1 1431, (1989); Broadstock, David C., The role of ESG performance during times of financial crisis: Evidence from COVID-19 in China, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Castro, Fernanda, Financing in an emerging economy: Does financial development or financial structure matter?, Emerging Markets Review, 23, pp. 96-123, (2015); Chen, Yangyang, Does managerial ability facilitate corporate innovative success?, Journal of Empirical Finance, 34, pp. 313-326, (2015); Cheng, Beiting, Corporate social responsibility and access to finance, Strategic Management Journal, 35, 1, pp. 1-23, (2014)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","01436570; 10991468","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187105486"

However, there has been limited research exploring the factors influencing corporate greenwashing, particularly from the perspective of pollution emissions. This study uses data from listed companies from 2011 to 2021 and employs a two-way fixed-effects model to unveil the correlation and mechanisms between carbon emissions and corporate greenwashing. Additionally, it examines the restraining effects of internal and external pressures on this relationship. The research reveals a significant positive correlation between corporate carbon emissions and greenwashing. Second, internal controls, audit regulations and regulatory regulations reversed this positive relationship. Third, the study finds that reducing risk tolerance and increasing employee compensation are pathways through which carbon emissions promote corporate engagement in greenwashing. Finally, this study indicates that the spillover effects of carbon emissions prompt other companies in the same city to engage in greenwashing. In conclusion, this study provides rich empirical evidence for the greenwashing literature and offers novel theoretical insights into promoting substantive green practices and carbon neutrality, particularly in developing countries such as China. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audit Regulation; Corporate Carbon Emission; Greenwashing Behaviour; Internal Controls; Statutory Regulation; Carbon Emission; Corporate Strategy; Developing World; Environmental Legislation; Green Economy; Pollution Control; Regulatory Framework; Spillover Effect; China","carbon emission; corporate strategy; developing world; environmental legislation; green economy; pollution control; regulatory framework; spillover effect; China","","","","Abraham, Santhosh, Improving the relevance of risk factor disclosure in corporate annual reports, British Accounting Review, 46, 1, pp. 91-107, (2014); International Journal of Management and Business Research, (2014); Agyei-Mensah, Ben Kwame, Internal control information disclosure and corporate governance: evidence from an emerging market, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 16, 1, pp. 79-95, (2016); International Journal of Empirical Finance, (2015); Aljughaiman, Abdullah A., The impact of greenhouse gas emission on corporate’s tail risk, Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment, 14, 1, pp. 68-85, (2024); Internal Control A Study of Concept and Themes, (2013); Balluchi, Federica, CSR and Greenwashing: A Matter of Perception in the Search of Legitimacy, CSR, Sustainability, Ethics and Governance, pp. 151-166, (2020); Buallay, Amina Mohammed, The role of audit committee attributes in corporate sustainability reporting: Evidence from banks in the Gulf Cooperation Council, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 21, 2, pp. 249-264, (2020); Cai, Xiang, Can direct environmental regulation promote green technology innovation in heavily polluting industries?

Our key finding is that Confucianism is positively associated with employee-friendly practices. We further identify three plausible economic channels through which Confucianism shapes employee-friendly treatment: valuing human-centric ethics, mitigating managerial myopia, and alleviating agency conflicts. Cross-sectionally, the documented impact is more prominent for firms operating with weaker union power and those with executives lacking overseas experience. Additionally, employee-friendly firms exhibit higher employee efficiency, innovation output, and firm value, indicating that investing in employee benefits ultimately translates into better financial performance.

Hence, it is pertinent to explore how distressed firms recover. Unfortunately, extant research sheds little light on the role of marketing in enabling distressed firms’ turnaround. Using a longitudinal dataset of U.S. firms, we empirically show that when the source of distress is firm-specific, it is marketing capability (as opposed to R&D and operations capabilities) that enables a turnaround. However, when distress is industry-driven, R&D capability is also beneficial. Further, although operations capability and cost-reduction actions do help distressed firms survive, they do not help firms regain financial well-being. Overall, these results highlight the importance of capabilities in the context of distressed firms and have implications for both firm managers and shareholders. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Distress; Marketing Capability; Operations Capability; R&d Capability; Turnaround","","","","","Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z- Score and ZETA® models, pp. 428-455, (2013); Altman, Edward I., Financial Distress Prediction in an International Context: A Review and Empirical Analysis of Altman's Z-Score Model, Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 28, 2, pp. 131-171, (2017); Antia, Kersi D., Franchisor-franchisee bankruptcy and the efficacy of franchisee governance, Journal of Marketing Research, 54, 6, pp. 952-958, (2017); Arora, Punit, Financially Linked Independent Directors and Bankruptcy Reemergence: The Role of Director Effort, Journal of Management, 44, 7, pp. 2665-2689, (2018); Lego Case Study, (2014); Aziz, Abdul, BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION ‐ AN INVESTIGATION OF CASH FLOW BASED MODELS, Journal of Management Studies, 25, 5, pp. 419-437, (1988); Bahadir, S.

Pursuing an integrated EU electricity market inadvertently heightened the interdependence between gas and electricity prices. The EU energy crisis, triggered by the gas supply shock, amplified power prices and their volatility. These volatility spikes led to substantial margin increases on power futures contracts crucial for mitigating electricity price risks. The increase in margins placed a substantial financial burden on EU power utilities. We document an almost eight-fold surge in required collateral for long positions in front-month EU power futures contracts during the one-year duration of the crisis. Throughout the crisis, EU utilities experienced lower sales and profitability compared to their US counterparts, and a portfolio of EU power utilities significantly underperformed a counterfactual portfolio of US power utilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electricity Markets Regulations; Financial Performance; Margins; Synthetic Controls; Zonal Vs Nodal Pricing","","","","Funding text 1: This paper was presented at the 2023 special-theme conference on The Effectiveness of Financial Regulation hosted by the School of Economics at the College of Management Academic Studies, Israel.

In 2012, the Government of India introduced the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT), a cap-and-trade scheme, to achieve energy efficiency for large-sized industries. The extant literature is divided on the impacts of environmental regulations on firm performance. While the win-win argument of Porter and Van der Linde (1991) proposes a positive effect, the cost-regulation theory suggests a negative impact. Against this backdrop, we examine the impact of the PAT scheme on energy efficiency and firm value. As an identification strategy, we employ difference-in-differences (DID) combined with propensity score matching methods on firm level data from 2006 to 2015. We do not find evidence of a statistically significant impact of the PAT scheme on firms' energy efficiency. In contrast, our results suggest that the scheme adversely affects firm value. Furthermore, we find that increased expenditure on repair and maintenance, research and development, rising plant and machinery purchases, and a fall in productivity are the potential channels through which the PAT scheme impacts firm value. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of energy intensity, firm value, and empirical specifications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Energy Efficiency; Environmental Regulation; Firm Value; Perform Achieve And Trade (pat); Commerce; Energy Intensity; Environmental Regulations; Global Warming; Repair; Cap And Trade; Cost Regulations; Firm Performance; Firm Value; Government Of India; Impact Energy; Large-sized; Perform Achieve And Trade; Regulation Theory; Win-win; Energy Efficiency; Empirical Analysis; Energy Efficiency; Energy Management; Energy Market; Firm Size; Global Warming; Governance Approach; India","Commerce; Energy Intensity; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Repair; Cap and trade; Cost regulations; Firm Performance; Firm value; Government of India; Impact energy; Large-sized; Perform achieve and trade; Regulation theory; Win-win; Energy efficiency; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; energy management; energy market; firm size; global warming; governance approach; India","","","We thank Amit Das, Vijaya C Subramanian, Parthajit Kayal, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

This article uses the GMM to conduct an empirical study on the data of 116 banks from 2014 to 2021. As expected, the results show a non-favorable effect of digital transformation on non-interest income, but financial inclusion successfully brings a positive note. Hence, to grow together with customers, while initially, banks may have to lower the interest charges, efforts to enhance everyone's pursuit for a better financial life may help banks to enjoy more profit via higher non-interest income. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; D63; Digital Transformation; Financial Inclusion; G21; Gmm; Non-interest Income; Banking; Empirical Analysis; Interest Rate; Profitability; Technological Development; China","banking; empirical analysis; interest rate; profitability; technological development; China","","","","Abedifar, Pejman, Non-interest income and bank lending, Journal of Banking and Finance, 87, pp. 411-426, (2018); Ahamed, M.

This paper examines the impact of ESG performance on enterprise value using data from 3139 Chinese A-listed companies spanning from 2010 to 2021. The results demonstrate that enhancing ESG performance significantly boosts enterprise value. Additionally, ESG initiatives can alleviate corporate financing constraints and stimulate green innovation, consequently driving enterprise value. Furthermore, the positive effect of ESG on enterprise value is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises, low-polluting enterprises, and small-scale enterprises. These findings deepen our understanding of how ESG influences enterprise value within the context of the dual-carbon goal, offering theoretical backing for companies and investors to bolster ESG management practices and aiding government efforts to enhance ESG macro guidance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dual Carbon Goals; Enterprise Value; Esg; Financing Constraints; Green Innovation","","","","","International Journal of Business and Management Sciences, (2022); Altomonte, Carlo, R&D investments, financing constraints, exporting and productivity, Economics of Innovation and New Technology, 25, 3, pp. 283-303, (2016); Amore, Mario Daniele, Corporate governance and green innovation, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 75, pp. 54-72, (2016); Impacts of Environmental Social and Governance Factors on Firm Performance Panel Study of Malaysian Companies, (2019); Aydoğmuş, Mahmut, Impact of ESG performance on firm value and profitability, Borsa Istanbul Review, 22, pp. S119-S127, (2022); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

Further analysis suggests that the enduring impact of floods on investment persists even after controlling for confounding short-term natural disasters, financial development level, and the Tangshan Earthquake. In addition, the impact of historical Yellow River flood arises from cumulative consequences, rather than individual flood outcomes.

Internal corporate governance has a significant impact on firm TPA activities and can boost firm value. The study also highlights the importance of the fraction of independent directors to management, the board size, and ownership concentration in moderating the relationship between TPA activities and firm value. The theoretical contribution of this paper lies in its identification of the synergistic effects of corporate governance and social responsibility performance on firm value in the context of poverty alleviation.

The research used an annual data set from 1992 to 2019 and applied a unique co-integrating method known as asymmetric ARDL co-integration approach. The macroeconomic variables of environmental pollution, trade balance, human development index, foreign direct investment, and natural resource rent were found to have significant influences on IPO variability in both long-run and short-run asymmetric impacts. These findings highlight the important roles of the used variables in increasing IPO variability. This research suggests that Pakistan’s weak macroeconomic conditions reflect the country’s inadequate capital market growth. The country’s lower IPO variability indicates a lack of trust among potential issuers and investors as a result of Pakistan’s weak macroeconomic indices.

Examining key elements such as board size, busy directors, independent directors, CEO duality, and women on the board, the research employs data collected from the annual reports of 30 banks spanning from 2010 to 2020. The necessary condition analysis (NCA) underscores that no individual condition or factor is indispensable for the ultimate outcome. Nevertheless, the sufficiency analysis reveals distinct solutions, each representing a unique set of conditions or factors sufficient to generate the outcome. The study concludes that the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and bank performance is complex and multifaceted, with neither ROA nor ROE reliant on a singular input condition or factor. The theoretical contributions of the findings align with or partially support various theories and propositions within the realm of corporate governance.

Using Chinese A-share listed companies panel data during 2007–2019, this study adopts the difference-in-differences model to explore the impact of LCCPP on firm green innovation. Based on theoretical analysis, LCCPP-driven environmental rules have the impact of encouraging business green innovation. The relationship between LCCPP and green innovation is strengthened by external media attention and organizational redundancy resources. The mechanism study shows that the incentive effect of LCCPP on firm green innovation is mainly due to the improvement of enterprises’ green total factor productivity and financial stability. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis shows that the LCCPP has significantly positive effects in promoting green innovation in high-carbon industries and state-owned enterprises.

The review shows that the fintech literature could be classified into four major thematic areas: inter-dynamics between banks and fintech, fintech business model, disruptive technology and footprints of fintech. Based on the ADO framework, the antecedents include the key drivers of fintech growth: disruptive technology, transparency, speed, cost-effectiveness, the improved credit assessment, government support, regulatory sandboxes and bank-fintech collaborations. Fintech companies make multifaceted business model decisions involving customer risk profiles, wealth advisory services, balancing tech-driven solutions with risk management, loan rates, investor protection and competitive returns. Fintech's impact extends to financial inclusion, support for consumption and entrepreneurship, risk reduction for SMEs and lower bankruptcy costs. Overall, fintech companies serve as complements and substitutes for traditional finance providers.

The estimates are derived from a regularized graphical model, which allows us to deal with two important issues. First, we refer to the curse of dimensionality, as we focus on a relatively large set of companies. Second, we explicitly take into account the heavy-tailed distributions of financial time series, which reflect the impact of crises and recessions. Focusing on a time interval spanning across well-known tail events, from the US subprime crisis to the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we show that the selected green stocks offer a relevant contribution to the minimization of the overall portfolio risk. Moreover, they outperform the gray assets in terms of risk, profitability, and risk-adjusted return in a statistically significant way. These findings are consistent with the estimates obtained from the network analysis. Indeed, the gray stocks exhibit a greater connection within the dynamic networks and, then, are more exposed to the risk of a greater propagation of negative spillover effects during stressed periods. Interestingly, the relevance of the green stocks increases when moving from the standard Gaussian to the leptokurtic setting.

Design/methodology/approach: For the Corporate Governance Index, the authors examined board accountability, transparency and disclosure and audit committee, while Tobin’s Q, return on equity and return on assets are used to measure the bank’s profitability. The study used a two-stage analysis based on balanced panel data for robust findings. Sample of this study consists of 60 commercial banks from India and 60 banks from SAARC nations for the period of 2009–2021. This study used panel regression and a generalized method of moment approach using the CAMELS framework on banking industry-specific variables to determine their respective impacts. Findings: The findings of this study suggest that board accountability is positive and significantly affects the profitability of banks as indicated by return on assets, return on equity and Tobin’s Q. In contrast, the audit committee has a positive and insignificant impact on return on assets, return on equity and Tobin’s Q, while transparency and disclosure have a negative and significant impact on these metrics. Furthermore, the country dummy result shows a significant positive impact on all the bank performance parameters, implying that Indian banks have the highest degree of convergence with corporate governance as compared to other SAARC nations. Research limitations/implications: This study provides insight to the regulators, policymakers and financial institutions to evaluate the role of corporate governance in emerging economies. However, the findings of the study should be interpreted with caution, as the results are sensitive to the disparity between India and other SAARC nations' government policies, climatic circumstances and cultural or religious traditions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to gauge the performance of Indian banks vis-à-vis SAARC nations using the CAMELS framework approach. Further, findings of this study suggest some novel evidence tying corporate governance quality with the profitability of banks among SAARC nations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commercial Banks; Corporate Governance; Emerging Economies; Profitability; Saarc","","","","","Abbott, Lawrence J., Audit committee characteristics and restatements, Auditing, 23, 1, pp. 69-87, (2004); Abdallah, Abed Al Nasser, Corporate governance practices, ownership structure, and corporate performance in the GCC countries, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 46, pp. 98-115, (2017); Journal of Accounting and Marketing, (2016); Aebi, Vincent, Risk management, corporate governance, and bank performance in the financial crisis, Journal of Banking and Finance, 36, 12, pp. 3213-3226, (2012); Aggarwal, Reena, Differences in governance practices between U.S. and foreign firms: Measurement, causes, and consequences, Review of Financial Studies, 22, 8, pp. 3131-3169, (2009); Akbar, Saeed, More on the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance in the UK: Evidence from the application of generalized method of moments estimation, Research in International Business and Finance, 38, pp. 417-429, (2016); Akhtar, Shakeb, Examine the key drivers affecting bottom line: A panel estimation study of indian commercial bank, Journal of Critical Reviews, 7, 9, pp. 1114-1125, (2020); Akhtar, Shakeb, Measuring the performance of the Indian banking industry: data envelopment window analysis approach, Benchmarking, 29, 9, pp. 2842-2857, (2022); Emerging Economies Cases Journal, (2021); Akhtar, Shakeb, Measuring technical efficiency of banks vis-à-vis demonetization: an empirical analysis of Indian banking sector using CAMELS framework, Quality and Quantity, 57, 2, pp. 1739-1761, (2023)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","14720701","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176103854"

Also, the study examined the influences of the interaction between cultural dimensions and individual (private) sentiment (investor sentiment). Design/methodology/approach: To meet the study's objectives, a two-step generalised method of moments estimator was applied to the study sample, which included 105 banks in the nine Middle East and North African region countries between 2010 and 2020. Findings: The cultural dimensions of individualism and masculinity were found to have a positive and significant effect on banks' buy and hold stock return (BUH). At the same time, power distance and uncertainty avoidance were discovered to have negative effects. Besides, the findings revealed that the interactions of power distance, individual sentiment and uncertainty avoidance had positive and significant relationships with banks' BUH. However, individualism, individual sentiment and masculinity had inverse relationships with banks' BUH. Furthermore, the findings revealed that investor sentiment positively influenced banks' BUH. Finally, uncertainty influenced banks' BUH stock returns positively.

As a result, using innovative decision-making strategies is expected to lead to significant returns in stock prices. Predicting the stock market proves challenging because of the limited volatility and inherent disorderliness observed within the data. Hence, investors need help optimizing their profits through informed predictions in the stock market. Stock market projections are made by employing mathematical approaches and machine learning methods. The stock market is inherently vulnerable to unforeseen changes due to its intricate nature and absence of a linear progression. Since the advent of personal computers and the proliferation of technological advancements in the 1990s, scholars have investigated the application of artificial intelligence in the investment sector. Many solutions have been created to tackle the matter of volatility in stock market prices. This study examined a total of 146 research articles that were published in academic journals over twelve years (2011-2023). These papers focused on applying artificial intelligence in predicting stock market trends. The listed works encompass several methodologies, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis.

Motivated by the paucity of research in this area, our study aims to investigate the impact of female managers on the credit risk of microfinance institutions (MFIs). We have collected data from 1004 unique MFIs across 96 countries, covering the period of 2010 to 2018, using the World Bank Mix Market data catalog. The data were then analyzed using several conventional tools and techniques, including endogeneity-corrected estimators. The findings revealed that the presence of female managers lowers the credit risk of MFIs. The result mostly remains consistent and robust across different techniques and proxies. Therefore, promoting gender diversity at the managerial level could promote the long-term sustainability of MFIs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Theory; Credit Risk; Female Managers; Gender Diversity; Microfinance Institutions","","","","The author would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments and suggestions in improving the manuscript.

CA is a management accounting tool whose application in small companies has always been difficult. Nevertheless, academicians and practitioners recommend CA implementation in SMEs, especially because of the deep market instability, competitive pressure, and margin erosion that have occurred following the COVID-19 pandemic and 2022 European war scenario. Company size influences CA implementation; however, it is not the only influencing factor and perhaps not even the most important. To investigate the barriers to the adoption of CA and which conditions or actions can remove these barriers, leveraging from the contingency theory, a questionnaire was sent out in July 2022 to limited liability SMEs operating in the manufacturing, construction, and distribution macro-sectors in Verona and Vicenza provinces (Italy). Respondents answered a set of questions regarding CA implementation in their SMEs as of July 2022. Using a multivariate regression model to analyze data from the 120 questionnaires received, we found that lack of resources, limited training and skills, firm age, and the presence of the founder in the firm had a negative influence on CA implementation in SMEs. The low level of CA implementation was also associated with its supposed inefficiency, uselessness, and unsuitability for business. The effect of company size on CA implementation was not statistically significant. Despite this study’s limitations regarding the sample and period considered, we believe that it contributes to both academic debates and practice by illustrating the limiting factors and ways in which CA implementation can be fostered in SMEs in turbulent years. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contingency Theory; Cost Accounting; Management Accounting; Smes","","","","","Adams, Renée B., Understanding the relationship between founder-CEOs and firm performance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 16, 1, pp. 136-150, (2009); Ahmed, Mirghani Nimir, Cost allocation in Britain: towards an institutional analysis, European Accounting Review, 9, 2, pp. 159-204, (2000); International Journal of Business and Social Science, (2021); Amoako-Gyampah, Kwasi, An extension of the technology acceptance model in an ERP implementation environment, Information and Management, 41, 6, pp. 731-745, (2004); A Framework for Assessing Cost Management System Changes the Case of Activity Based Costing Implementation at General Motors 1986 1993, (1995); Armitage, Howard M., The Use of Management Accounting Techniques by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: A Field Study of Canadian and Australian Practice, Accounting Perspectives, 15, 1, pp. 31-69, (2016); Ates, Aylin, Change process: A key enabler for building resilient SMEs, International Journal of Production Research, 49, 18, pp. 5601-5618, (2011); Baiman, Stanley, Agency research in managerial accounting: A second look, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 15, 4, pp. 341-371, (1990); Becker, Wolfgang, Management accounting and controlling in German SMEs - Do company size and family influence matter?, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Venturing, 3, 3, pp. 281-300, (2011); Bhamra, Ran S., Resilience: The concept, a literature review and future directions, International Journal of Production Research, 49, 18, pp. 5375-5393, (2011)","","Springer","","","","","","15547191","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181253415"

However, at the microlevel, research in this area is lacking, as attention is paid on the comprehensive capabilities of top managers, industrial heterogeneity, and heterogeneous green innovation (GI), including inventive innovation and utility innovation. Based on Upper Echelons Theory, this paper constructs a research framework to explore and empirically analyze the specific impact of managerial capacity (MA) of top managers, as “gatekeepers” of enterprise decision-making, on the heterogeneous enterprise GI, as well as its potential mechanism. Our results shows that (1), overall, MA can significantly promote GI of enterprises. Interestingly, compared with green strategic innovation, managerial capacity has a greater effect on green inventive innovation; (2) based on industrial heterogeneity, in heavy-polluting industries, managerial capacity is more likely to promote green strategic innovation rather than green inventive innovation; (3) further analysis shows that enterprise value, internal control quality, and financing constraints are important mechanisms; and (4) the moderating effect of external environment shows that to some extent either the regional marketization level or management capabilities can drive GI. This paper has practical implications for policymakers and corporate managers adopting the management heterogeneity perspective and suggests areas for future studies in this field to promote green low-carbon transition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Action Mechanism; Heterogeneous Green Innovation; Industry Heterogeneity; Managerial Capacity; Corporate Strategy; Decision Making; Future Prospect; Heterogeneity; Industrial Development; Innovation; Strategic Approach; China","corporate strategy; decision making; future prospect; heterogeneity; industrial development; innovation; strategic approach; China","","","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Social Science Fund of China 22AJY006, Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China 21&ZD133, the Social Science Fund of Xinjiang 21BJY049, Social Science Cultivating Project of Xinjiang University 23GPY003, Autonomous Region Postgraduate Education Teaching Re‐form Project XJ2023GY08, Autonomous Region Postgraduate Innovation Project XJ2023G059, General Project of the Institute of Central Asian Studies of Xinjiang University (24ZYYB018), National Natural Science Foundation of China (72321002), the Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province of China (2022C35060), the Technology Innovation Program of Beijing Institute of Technology (2022CX01013), and the Special Fund for Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.","Accounting Research, (2022); Amore, Mario Daniele, Corporate governance and green innovation, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 75, pp. 54-72, (2016); Readings in Industrial Economics, (1972); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Batt, Rosemary, Managing customer services: Human resource practices, quit rates, and sales growth, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 3, pp. 587-597, (2002); Beal, Reginald M., Performance implications of aligning CEO functional experiences with competitive strategies, Journal of Management, 26, 4, pp. 733-762, (2000); Bertrand, Marianne, Managing with style: The effect of managers on firm policies, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, 4, pp. 1169-1208, (2003); Finance and Trade Economics, (2016); Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Bresciani, Stefano, Using big data for co-innovation processes: Mapping the field of data-driven innovation, proposing theoretical developments and providing a research agenda, International Journal of Information Management, 60, (2021)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176909609"

Thus, financial digitalization and business environment directives help improve the financial performance of business enterprises. This study assesses the role of product market competitiveness on firm performance through the mediating role of digital financial innovation. The annual data of 90 companies from 2014 to 2020 is taken from the Pakistan stock exchange market. The empirical results are estimated using three paths by the Structural Equation Model (SEM) regression approach. The study identifies that product market competitiveness positively contributed to determining the firm performance. Besides, digital financial innovation serves as the mediator in the study, which partially positively determines firm performance. It shows that firm financial innovation fails to account fully for firm performance. This study does not include several other factors determining firm performance. The research results deliver a useful empirical and theoretical contribution to digitalization and product innovation. The findings help to uncover the antecedents of financial innovation and firm performance. This research model can assist researchers in designing robust strategies to appraise the impact on firm performance. Investigators may advance valuable insights by integrating this methodology.

The purpose of this research is to provide more evidence of the impact of CEO power on innovation as a business strategy. We also address the moderating effect that national culture has on the relationship between CEO power and innovation. The Thomson Reuters database provided the data for this research. The cohort of firms represents different countries, specifically, a sample of firms from 37 countries. To estimate the model, we used the generalised method of moments (GMM) procedure, an estimator that allows the researcher to control for unobservable heterogeneity and endogeneity. GMM also attenuates estimation bias. Our findings reveal that CEO power has a positive effect on innovation. In turn, the dimensions of national culture used here do not have the same moderating effect on the relationship between CEO power and innovation. Power distance and uncertainty avoidance negatively moderate the positive association between CEO power and innovation; individualism and indulgence reinforce the positive effect of CEO power on innovation; masculinity and long-term orientation do not affect the relationship. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Power; Innovation; National Culture; Business Development; Firm Ownership; Individualism; Innovation","business development; firm ownership; individualism; innovation","","","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support from the Ministry of Science and Innovation through the project GELESMAT (PID2021‐122419OB‐I00)/AEI/ 10.13039/5011000110 and by FEDER Una manera de hacer Europa.

Some financial decisions are riskier than others, and as such can result in higher or lower profitability. This risk-return trade-off is the key aspect of financial management. Furthermore, a financial director's propensity to take risks can lead to less or more conservative financial decisions. This study firstly provides theoretical issues on financial management and the results of previous research, while the second part is empirical, showing the methodology and results of the authors' research. Apart from CFO risk attitude, the book also examines CFO power. The book highlights the importance of the position of financial managers in companies and demonstrates that financial decisions are the reflection of decision-makers' characteristics. Additionally, the book provides evidence of whether the COVID-19 crisis has increased or decreased the impact of CFO characteristics on financial decision-making and firm performance. The book will attract the attention of researchers and students of corporate finance and accounting and also contains many valuable tips and insights for practitioners. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Aboody, David, CEO stock option awards and the timing of corporate voluntary disclosures, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 29, 1, pp. 73-100, (2000); Adams, Renée B., A theory of friendly boards, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 217-250, (2007); Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Adhikari, Binay Kumar, Female executives and corporate cash holdings, Applied Economics Letters, 25, 13, pp. 958-963, (2018); International Business Research, (2015); Journal of Money and Business, (2022); de Almeida, Neirilaine Silva, Determinants of accounting choice: do CFOs’ characteristics matter?, Management Research Review, 43, 2, pp. 185-203, (2020); Global Business and Management Research, (2018); New York Times, (2002); Anderson, Ronald C., The Economics of Director Heterogeneity, Financial Management, 40, 1, pp. 5-38, (2011)","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9781032752808; 9781003473190","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186379110"

It is a tool capable of better representing the ability of companies to create value over time. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the CEO’s characteristics (age, gender, education and experience) and firm performance through a mediating variable, namely, IR. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a quantitative research and used panel data. Based on a sample of 449 UK firms or using a sample of 449 UK companies between 2010 and 2020 on STATA17 and structural equation model was used to analyze data and test hypotheses. Findings: The results show that IR has only indirect mediation on the relationship between CEO’s characteristics and firm performance but mediates the relationship between CEO experience and performance in a complementary manner. Originality/value: This article is motivated by the low number of works in the context about the corporate social responsibility and sustainability issues. It makes an important contribution to the academic literature by adding to the limited body of research on CEO’s characteristics, IR and firm performance.

Data was collected from banks' monthly financial reports published on the Indonesia Financial Service Authority (OJK) website from 2014 to 2020, resulting in 82 observations. Data analysis was conducted using the Value at Risk (VaR) method with the variance-covariance approach. Among many methods, VaR is one of the most popular techniques that yields the most comprehensive results in measuring risk and return. The findings reveal that, in general, all equity and debt-based financings yielded stable risk and returns. However, equity-based financings produced higher returns, but also generated higher risks due to their uncertain nature. The results also demonstrate that risk management in Islamic banks improved gradually during the observation period, as indicated by the average score of portfolio combinations. These findings suggest that Islamic banks should balance their product offerings between equity-based financing and debt-based financing while simultaneously strengthening risk management, especially for murabahah products in equity-based financing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Debt-based Financing; Equity-based Financing; Risk Management; Value At Risk; Variance-covariance","","","","","Int J of Multidisciplinary and Current Research, (2021); International Journal of Social Service and Research Ijssr, (2022); Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance, (2020); Al Fiqh Al Islami Wa Adillatuh, (1997); Shariah Investment Agreement, (2021); Jurnal Manajemen Edisi Elektronik, (2021); Bank Syariah Dari Teori Ke Praktik, (2001); Jbti Jurnal Bisnis Teori Dan Implementasi, (2021); Inferensi Jurnal Penelitian Sosial Keagamaan, (2016); Bazih, Jad H., Deriving value or risk?

Panel regression analysis was used to conduct an empirical study on 69 IBs operating in 14 MENA countries over the 2012–2022 period. The dependent variable is the market value. The independent variables are the SSB size, the educational qualification of its members, their expertise, the gender diversity among its members and their independence. We also used the generalized method of moments (GMM) to test the robustness of first results. Our empirical results show that SSB size, SSB educational qualifications and SSB members expertise positively impact IBs’ market value, while gender diversity and independence of SSB members have no significant impact. Dynamic regression analysis provides evidence on the dependence of the bank market value on its lagged variable. This study contributes to the existing limited literature on the effect of SSB attributes on the market value in Islamic banks. It presents the essential of studies dealing with the issue and includes an empirical investigation on how these attributes influence the market valuation in Islamic banks in MENA region.

Macroeconomic conditions significantly influence dividend payout policies, as they reflect business prospects and forecast a firm's future cash-earning capacity. These conditions help management decide whether to distribute cash earnings as dividends or retain them for growth or precautionary reasons. Macroeconomic factors are typically categorized into Short-Term Macroeconomic Factors (STMF) and Long-Term Macroeconomic Factors (LTMF). Despite the straightforward logic behind these classifications, scholarly consensus remains elusive. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate by examining the impact of macroeconomic factors on dividend policies, focusing on non-financial companies in the ASEAN region-a dynamic global area. We analyzed a sample of 2,193 ASEAN companies using annual data from 2011 to 2021, resulting in 24,123 observations. Employing the General Method of Moments (GMM) dynamic panel regression, the study finds that STMF negatively affects dividend payouts, while LTMF positively influences them. This distinction between short-term and long-term impacts has significant practical and regulatory implications. These findings hold up well when subjected to various robustness checks. Regulators need to maintain stable environment for firms by recognizing the importance of strong governance frameworks in fostering investor confidence, while investors need to be well-informed in response to uncertainty, as it can impact dividend and investment returns. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asean; Dividend Payout; Economic Policy Uncertainty; General Method Of Moment; Governance Indicator; Macroeconomy Condition; Non-financial Companies","","","","","Ahmad, Muhammad Farooq, Firm-level political risk and dividend payout, International Review of Financial Analysis, 86, (2023); Ethiopian Journal of Economics, (2015); Akhtar, Muhammad Naveed, Impact of financial leverage on sustainable growth, market performance, and profitability, Economic Change and Restructuring, 55, 2, pp. 737-774, (2022); Al-Jalahma, Abdulla, Impact of audit committee characteristics on firm performance: Evidence from Bahrain, Problems and Perspectives in Management, 20, 1, pp. 247-261, (2022); Al-Najjar, Basil, The association between dividend payout and outside directorships, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 10, 1, pp. 4-19, (2009); Farooque, Omar Al, Board, audit committee, ownership and financial performance – emerging trends from Thailand, Pacific Accounting Review, 32, 1, pp. 54-81, (2020); Allen, Franklin, Chapter 7 Payout policy, Handbook of the Economics of Finance, 1, SUPPL.

However, these effects vary among farmers with different income levels. High-income farmers are most impacted by MFS adoption in terms of entrepreneurial revenue, whereas low-income farmers are most affected by MFS adoption in terms of entrepreneurial engagement and willingness. A significant and positive effect of MFS adoption on entrepreneurial profits is observed for high-income farmers, whereas the effect is insignificant for medium-income farmers.

More specifically, this study provides a depiction of ten mergers of HEIs in Greece that were introduced by the state in order to absorb the previously existent thirteen technological educational institutes (TEIs) from Greek universities. The morphology of mergers is provided by examining several factors, such as: type of merger (merger by absorption or consolidation); type and number of entity involvement (two-partner or multi-partner); geographical area of newly formed HEIs (single-campus or multi-campus), with provision of number of campuses in different cities, etc. These merger characteristics are associated with the HEI performance in the post-merger era, and their performance is evaluated with public accounting metrics and funding on specific ratios imposed by the Greek state. The results provide evidence that public HEIs in Greece throughout the process of joining entities have demonstrated different levels of synergies after mergers, in terms of state funding, with better results for the case where there are campuses in three different cities. Also, this study supports that a state initiative for legislative intervention in HEI mergers could lead to different levels of synergies. Last, this study tries to provide new knowledge for the gap of economic impact of mergers’ characteristics of HEIs and offers an open framework for further research on a fruitful area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Greece; Higher Education Institutions; Merger Characteristics; Mergers; Performance","","","","","Aarrevaara, Timo, Merger mania? the finnish higher education experience, Higher Education Dynamics, 46, pp. 59-72, (2016); Agasisti, Tommaso, Do merger policies increase universities’ efficiency?

Design/methodology/approach: This paper views the GCG policy proposed in 2012 as a quasinatural experiment and uses difference-in-differences (DID) model to evaluate its influence on the ESG scores of Chinese nonfinancial A-share listed enterprises from 2007 to 2019. Robustness tests include the propensity score matching (PSM)–DID method and permutation tests. Findings: The GCG policy significantly increases the ESG scores of restricted enterprises, particularly enhancing environmental (E) performance. However, it only improves the social (S) and governance (G) performance of firms heavily reliant on bank credit, indicating speculative behavior by enterprises. Increased Government attention, a higher proportion of female executives and more developed local green finance reduce speculative behavior, while executives with financial backgrounds promote it. Practical implications: Governments should mandate standardized ESG reporting and monitor restricted enterprises, banks should monitor speculative behavior and firms should integrate ESG into their long-term strategies to support sustainable development. Social implications: The results provide evidence of the effectiveness of implementing the GCG policy in China and offer guidance for better promoting green credit policy in developing countries, contributing to the transition toward a more sustainable future. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to explore if the GCG policy’s asymmetric effects on ESG components are due to enterprise speculative behavior and examines the factors influencing this behavior, providing insights for regulators to better implement the GCG policy to promote sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Performance; Esg Scores; Green Credit Guidelines Policy; Speculative Behavior; Sustainable Development","","","","Funding: This research was supported by the General Projects of the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 23AJL002) and the Beijing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era Center (Grant No. 22LLLJB032).","Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Asante-Appiah, Bright, The role of the external auditor in managing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reputation risk, Review of Accounting Studies, 28, 4, pp. 2589-2641, (2023); Bazel-Shoham, Ofra, Board gender diversity, feminine culture, and innovation for environmental sustainability, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 41, 2, pp. 293-322, (2024); Blundell, Richard W., Evaluation Methods for Non-Experimental Data, Fiscal Studies, 21, 4, pp. 427-468, (2000); Bruno, Michelangelo, An overview of the european policies on esg in the banking sector, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 22, (2021); Camilleri, Mark A., Environmental, social and governance disclosures in Europe, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 6, 2, pp. 224-242, (2015); Chen, Qi, The effects of bank mergers on corporate information disclosure, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 64, 1, pp. 56-77, (2017); Cronqvist, Henrik, Shaped by their daughters: Executives, female socialization, and corporate social responsibility, Journal of Financial Economics, 126, 3, pp. 543-562, (2017); Land Economics, (1986); Doan, Trang, Are female top executives more risk-averse or more ethical?

The Matthew Effect prevails at the individual, organizational, and country-global levels. This interdisciplinary review connects the Holy Bible with agency theory, tournament theory, corporate social responsibility (CSR), prospect theory, behavioral economics, the psychology of money, and business ethics in the literature. In this chapter, I expand the Matthew Effect, incorporate prospect theory and the love of money (1 Timothy 6: 9–10), and develop a multi-level theory of the Matthew Effect in Monetary Wisdoms: Individual decision-makers select their deep-rooted values (avaricious monetary aspiration, the love of money attitude), apply their rigorous and creative scientific mind and an artistic lens, incorporate contextualization, frame the critical concerns—challenging moral issues (good cases) in the immediate and omnibus contexts (good barrels), and and help them become good apples, choice architects, and moral and ethical decision-makers to maximize expected utility and ultimate serenity across context, people, and time at the individual, organizational, and country-global levels.

This study examines the influence of firm-specific variables that determine the Capstr decisions of firms from the fintech industry. The data for this study is sourced through the Refinitiv Database consisting of the worldwide fintech industry. The selected sample consists of 186 firms from across the global fintech industry. Through a quantitative approach, we have used panel regression, supported by descriptive statistics and correlation, considering the annual financial published data of the selected firms for a period from 2011 to 2021. The data used in the study comprises of an unbalanced and a cross-sectional data of 1000 firm/year observations, imported from the selected 186 firms. The findings conclude that the firm size (FS), profitability (Prft), tangibility ratio (Tr) and volatility (Vol) have a significant impact on Total debt ratio (TDr) and Short term debt ratio (SDr), However only profitability (Prft) has a significant impact on Long term debt ratio (LDr).

The structure of board directors, key influencers to corporate decisions, notably shape policies, crucially in emerging markets like China where gender issues are still evolving. Therefore, employing a penal dataset comprising 8,973 firm-year observations from publicly A-share-listed Chinese firms spanning 2006 to 2021, this study empirically examines the impact of board gender diversity on the responsiveness to both employee monetary incentives and non-monetary rewards. The findings unveil a positive correlation, indicating an augmentation in per-employee compensation and an increased likelihood of implementing non-monetary programs, including stock-ownership plans, retirement benefits, and occupational safety certification, in the presence of higher board gender diversity. Notably, these positive associations are more accentuated in state-owned firms, as well as those with lower executive compensation and diminished institutional ownership. Our results remain consistent after considering robustness as well as endogeneity. This empirical evidence not only contributes robust statistical support to the ongoing global initiatives advocating for gender diversity in corporate governance but also underscores the efficacy of boards of directors in effectively managing stakeholder interests, particularly in fostering employee-friendly practices within emerging markets like China. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Gender Diversity; Employee Benefits; Female Directors; Monetary Incentives; Nonmonetary Rewards","","","","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

It explores the relationships between coordinated care, expert leadership, provider-patient communications, and the patient experience. When clinical and nonclinical staff collaborate effectively, healthcare teams can improve patient outcomes, prevent medical errors, improve efficiency, and increase patient satisfaction. Surprisingly, however, healthcare leaders tend to prioritize specific metrics to improve hospital performance and patient satisfaction even though patient experience and provider-patient communications are intertwined. Determining the most effective strategy for achieving higher levels of service quality and patient satisfaction can prove elusive for providers. Consider the evidence: a survey in 2012 of more than 17,000 healthcare leaders in North America, for example, found that leaders’ perceptions did not always match the data, and many hospital leaders overestimated the performance of their hospitals. Over 75% of the hospital leaders reported “quality of care” was something their hospital did well, while their patients, on average, rated them lower on perceived service quality. Ten years later, in 2022, only a few providers integrated best practices to achieve high patient satisfaction which severely impacted CMS Hospital Star Rating. This has significant effects on profit margins since patients consider the star rating differentials in their choices of hospitals and are willing to pay upward of 17% extra for treatments in 5-star hospitals, a revenue generating source of income at times when hospitals have seen falling revenues (down 4.8%) and rising labor (up 37%) from pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. To reduce the gap between perception and reality, hospital leaders can consider the link between communication goals (e.g., responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines) and outcomes (e.g., increased adherence and compliance, readmission, healthcare delivery costs, hospital overall ratings) as well as improve the patient experience. When intentions and outcomes are aligned, they create a powerful medium by which healthcare leaders can evaluate the gaps that exist between patient care measures and best practices and mitigate organizational or technological factors relevant to improving the patient experience. When the alignment is optimal, care teams develop a better sense of shared purpose, become more committed and accountable, and work together to improve the patient experience. When accomplished, patients participate more fully and actively in the exchange and are discharged with an enhanced commitment to carry out care management requirements.

By contrast, the current study is located in China and analyses whether ESG reduces the downside risk of listed companies in China, and whether political connections and institutional investors moderate this relationship. This study uses Chinese A-share listed companies from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets from 2010 to 2021 as research samples. Results demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of enhancing ESG performance on enterprise risk is more significant in non-heavy polluting industries, non-state-owned enterprises, and enterprises in areas with low levels of marketisation. This study explores the economic implications of ESG performance from a Value-at-Risk (VaR) perspective, enriching the relevant research on ESG rating in China and providing a fresh perspective to better elucidate the economic significance of companies improving their ESG performance. This study introduces institutional investors and political connections as two moderating variables to analyse their effect on the relationship between ESG performance and VaR. In addition, heterogeneity analysis is carried out in combination with the industry, region, and ownership nature of listed companies to test the “insurance” and “information” effects of ESG performance, to provide decision-making references for investors, enterprise managers, and regulators. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esg; Institutional Investors; Iv-gmm; Political Connections; Var","","","","","Aluchna, Maria, Do institutional investors encourage firm to social disclosure?

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs the time-varying parameter vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) technique and analyzes daily data from December 1, 2008 to July 14, 2021. Findings: The research reveals robust interconnectedness within individual countries between Islamic and conventional stock markets, particularly during crises. Islamic stock markets exhibit greater susceptibility to spillover effects compared to conventional stocks. The UAE and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) stock markets are identified as net transmitters of spillovers, while Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait receive more spillovers than they transmit. Global financial uncertainty measures (GVZ, USEPU and UKEPU) positively influence financial market interconnectedness, with EVZ exhibiting a negative impact while VIX and OVX remain statistically insignificant. Practical implications: Investors and portfolio managers in Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait should carefully evaluate the UAE and KSA markets before making investment decisions due to the latter's role as net transmitters in the region. Additionally, it is emphasized that Islamic and conventional stocks should not be considered interchangeable asset classes for risk hedging. Social implications: Investors must be aware that Islamic and conventional stocks cannot be used as an alternative asset class to hedge risk. Originality/value: The present article offers valuable insights for practitioners and researchers delving into the comparative analysis of Islamic and conventional stock markets within the GCC context. It enhances our comprehension of the dynamic interdependence between Islamic and conventional stock markets in the GCC economies and the impact of global financial uncertainties on this intricate relationship. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Connectedness; Conventional Stock; Gcc; Islamic Stock; Tvp-var","","","","The authors extend their sincere appreciation to the Researchers Supporting Project number (RSPD2024R1038), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the financial support.","Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, How COVID-19 drives connectedness among commodity and financial markets: Evidence from TVP-VAR and causality-in-quantiles techniques, Resources Policy, 70, (2021); Dembetembe, Gift Garikai, Does oil connect differently with prominent assets during war?

The strategic investment in both IC and physical capital allows firms to enhance FP by optimizing resource utilization. However, non-financial firms in Pakistan often encounter a deficiency in tangible and intangible resources, skills, and competencies necessary for FP improvement. Consequently, these firms prioritize acquiring intangible skills, such as human skills and innovative activities, to enhance FP. Effective management of IC is vital for maintaining competitiveness and sustaining a competitive advantage through continued reinvestment in IC. Thus, this study explores the dynamic impact of investment in IC resources and financial stability on FP, MV, and bankruptcy risk. Additionally, the study examines how firm financial stability moderates the IC-FP association. Employing the system generalized method of moments (system-GMM), this study analyzes the dynamic association between IC and FP using an unbalanced panel of Pakistani non-financial firms spanning from 2010 to 2021. The results validate the theoretical prediction of a dynamic association, indicating that both current and past investments in aggregate or components of IC collectively influence FP, MV, and bankruptcy risk. Notably, the findings underscore the more substantial impact of structural capital efficiency (SCE) compared to human capital efficiency (HCE) on FP, MV, and bankruptcy risk. Furthermore, the study reveals that the level of financial stability within firms moderates the relationship between investment in IC and FP, MV, and bankruptcy risk. This study contributes to the IC literature by empirically analyzing the impact of both aggregate and component aspects of IC on FP, MV, and bankruptcy risk within the context of Pakistan, an emerging market. Moreover, it contributes by reaffirming the efficacy of the dynamic association between IC and FP, MV, and bankruptcy risk while also examining the moderating influence of financial stability on this relationship. The findings highlight the potential of IC investment in helping firms navigate financial turbulence during periods of economic instability, thereby holding significant practical and policy implications for firm management, owners, investors, and creditors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bankruptcy Risk; Dynamic Association; Financial Stability; Intellectual Capital","","","","","Abeysekera, Indra, The influence of board size on intellectual capital disclosure by Kenyan listed firms, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 11, 4, pp. 504-518, (2010); Agustia, Dian, Earnings management, business strategy, and bankruptcy risk: evidence from Indonesia, Heliyon, 6, 2, (2020); Ahamad, Shamsuddin, Impact of Intellectual Capital on Microfinance Institutions’ Efficiency: the Moderating Role of External Governance, Journal of the Knowledge Economy, 14, 2, pp. 691-717, (2023); Ahmad, Fawad, Modified VAIC model: measuring missing components information and treatment of exogenous factors, Managerial Finance, 49, 9, pp. 1453-1473, (2023); Ahmad, Muhammad, Testing the relationship between intellectual capital and a firm's performance: An empirical investigation regarding financial industries of Pakistan, International Journal of Learning and Intellectual Capital, 13, 2-3, pp. 250-272, (2016); European Journal of Management Studies, (2021); Ali, Yasir, Corporate social responsibility and employee performance: The mediating role of employee engagement in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 6, pp. 2908-2919, (2020); Ali, Shahid, Intellectual capital and financial performance: A comparative study, Frontiers in Psychology, 13, (2022); Almamy, Jeehan, An evaluation of Altman's Z-score using cash flow ratio to predict corporate failure amid the recent financial crisis: Evidence from the UK, Journal of Corporate Finance, 36, pp. 278-285, (2016); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968)","","Springer","","","","","","18687873; 18687865","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192802334"

In particular, the authors study the mediating effects of board characteristics such as board size, independence and gender diversity. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 100 audit clients listed on the FTSE 100 from 2015 to 2021, this study uses structural equation modelling to test the research objectives. Findings: The findings indicate a significant and negative association between disruptive technology adoption by audit clients and inherent risk. However, there is no significant evidence observed for control risk. The utilisation of disruptive technology by the audit client has a significant impact on the board characteristics, resulting in an increase in board size, greater independence and gender diversity. The authors also find strong evidence that board independence mediates the association between disruptive technology usage and both inherent risk and control risk. In addition, board size and gender exhibit distinct and differential mediating effects on the association and across the two types of risks. Research limitations/implications: The study reveals that the significant role of using disruptive technology by audit clients in reducing the risk of material misstatements is closely associated with the board of directors, which makes audit clients place greater emphasis on the construction of effective corporate governance. Practical implications: This study offers essential primary evidence that can assist policymakers and standard setters in formulating guidance and recommendations for board size, independence and gender quotas, ensuring the enhancement of effective governance and supporting the future of audit within the next generation of digital services. Social implications: With respect to relevant stakeholders, it is imperative for audit clients to recognise that corporate governance represents a fundamental means of addressing the ramifications of applying disruptive technology, particularly as they pertain to inherent and control risks within the audit client. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by investigating the joint impact of corporate governance and the utilisation of disruptive technology by audit clients on inherent risk and control risk, which has not been investigated by previous research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Governance; Disruptive Technology","","","","","Aguilera, Ruth, Bridging Accounting and Corporate Governance: New Avenues of Research, International Journal of Accounting, 56, 1, (2021); Alhababsah, Salem, Does shared tenure between audit committee chair and engagement partner affect audit outcomes?

The findings show that the COVID-19 stringency index has a short-term positive effect on stock market returns and a negative effect in the long-run. Furthermore, the findings show negative correlations between stock market returns and global economic policy uncertainty in the long run and a negative effect in the short-run.

However, the adoption of advanced SRI strategies that go beyond the mere exclusion of companies or asset classes has not kept pace with this expansion, a critical development regarding its potential impact on sustainability. For this reason, this study aims to identify the main drivers for the adoption of advanced sustainable and responsible investment practices by asset management companies to know why and which companies better advance the strengthening of SRI in the European financial market considering an original combination of different SRI drivers. To investigate which factors seem to be more decisive in adopting more sophisticated SRI practices, we first conducted a survey among fund management companies that manage and/or distribute investment funds in Europe. Second, we used logistic and multivariate regressions as analytical tools for testing the hypotheses. Results show that societal pressures and a formal corporate social responsibility policy are the main drivers for adopting advanced SRI practices by asset management companies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Sri Practices; Asset Management Companies; Environmental; Social And Governance (esg) Factors; Sustainable And Responsible Investment (sri); Sustainable Development","","","","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Maria Folqu\u00E9 and Teresa Corzo did not receive support from any organization for the submitted work.

Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from heavily polluting industries from 2011 to 2021, this study finds that the manager’s green experience significantly improves the carbon emission performance of the company. By exploring potential mechanisms, this study confirms that the promotion effect of the manager’s green experience on corporate carbon emission performance is driven by higher green attention and a larger scale of green investment. Heterogenous tests show that the impact of the manager’s green experience on carbon emission is diluted in state-owned enterprises, companies with better corporate governance, and regions with stronger environmental regulation.

However, predicting CEO behaviour remains challenging, especially when considering CEO power (CEOP). Hence, this study explores the link between CEOP and firm risk-taking (FRT) in selected firms on the stock market in Vietnam from 2010 to 2020. Utilizing the Entropy weight methodology, a CEOP index combines structural, ownership, and expert power indicators. The SYS-GMM approach mitigates potential endogeneity issues, revealing a positive correlation between CEOP and FRT. Interestingly, CEO risk aversion increases in state-owned firms’ participants, suggesting heightened supervision. Moreover, each characteristic of the CEOP index uniquely influences FRT.

The sector opts for diversification techniques and CSR initiatives in a competitive business environment for growth, survival and reputation. This study examined the impact of corporate diversification and CSR on the financial performance of South Asian manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: Data is obtained from the financial statements of 350 listed South Asian manufacturing firms as well as the respective stock exchanges of these countries. The data for research analysis ranges from 2010 to 2020. Diversification is measured using product diversification and geographic diversification. CSR is quantified in terms of social contribution value. Accounting measurements (ROA and ROE) are also used to capture corporate performance. For hypothesis testing, the study also uses fixed effect panel regression, and for assessing the robustness of the findings, the two-step dynamic panel system-GMM regression approach is used. Findings: Findings of study indicate a positive impact of product and geographic diversification on financial performance measured with ROA. However, geographic diversification is insignificantly linked with ROA and ROE. Further, CSR positively impacts the performance of firms in South Asia with both performance measures. Originality/value: The study has several policy implications based on the findings, including the need for the manufacturing sector to practice and implement appropriate diversification approaches and CSR initiatives to improve its financial performance and reputation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Diversification; Csr; Firm Performance; Panel Data; South Asia","","","","","Pakistan Journal of Commerce and Social Sciences, (2008); Aguilera, Ruth, Putting the s back in corporate social responsibility: A multilevel theory of social change in organizations, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 836-863, (2007); Al-Twaijry, Abdulrahman Ali M., Dividend policy and payout ratio: evidence from the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, Journal of Risk Finance, 8, 4, pp. 349-363, (2007); Ali, Waris, The role of normative CSR-promoting institutions in stimulating CSR disclosures in developing countries, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 25, 4, pp. 373-390, (2018); Arte, Pratik, Moderating influence of product diversification on the international diversification-performance relationship: A meta-analysis, Journal of Business Research, 139, pp. 1408-1423, (2022); Ayaz, Muhammad, An empirical investigation on the impact of capital structure on firm performance: evidence from Malaysia, Managerial Finance, 47, 8, pp. 1107-1127, (2021); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Campbell, John L., Institutional analysis and the paradox of corporate social responsibility, American Behavioral Scientist, 49, 7, pp. 925-938, (2006); Cherian, Jacob Poopada, Does corporate social responsibility affect the financial performance of the manufacturing sector?

To get the global banking industry back on its feet, regulations existing at the time were strengthened and new ones were introduced. While the industry has come a long way in clawing back its reputation, research on the present state of reputations of some global banks suggests that these reputations are still underpinned by national regulators. In the South African context, it is not clear to what extent bank reputations are underpinned by the reputation of the main banking regulator: the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). This article looks at perceptions of private banking customers to ascertain whether they believe that bank reputations derive from the reputation of the regulator. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research methodology was applied. Purposive sampling was used to collect data from 111 banking customers using a Likert scale. Four hypotheses on reputation-regulation relationships were then tested using the non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Findings/results: The results show that regulation plays no role in how private banking customers perceive bank reputations. Practical implications: This study highlights that there is little scope for banks to accrue ‘reputational rent’ by free riding on the reputation of the regulator. Banks must therefore take steps to proactively engage in their own reputation building exercises. Originality/value: This research is the first to look at the reputation–regulation interface in the local banking industry from private banking customers’ perspective. It highlights that each bank must work hard to build the re utation it desires. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Reputation; Deregulated Markets; Global Financial Crisis; Information Asymmetry; Regulation; Stakeholders","","","","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.","Baker, Andrew, Restraining regulatory capture?

Employing a rigorous sample selection process and utilizing data from reliable databases, the research employs a comprehensive methodology to explore the intricate corporate sustainability-related dynamics influencing organizational success and societal impact. The findings reveal a compelling negative correlation between managerial ability and CSR performance, corroborating previous research and suggesting potential challenges in reconciling managerial competence with social responsibility priorities. Furthermore, this paper establishes a negative correlation between CSR and firm value, with managerial ability influencing the magnitude of this impact, underscoring the significance of managerial skills in moderating the relationship between CSR initiatives and overall corporate performance. Moreover, the study uncovers a robust positive correlation between managerial ability and firm value, emphasizing the pivotal role of adept leadership in achieving higher corporate valuation.

First, is an increase in the number of countries involved in ownership of a co-patent an effective way to enhance patent quality? Second, if the objective is to raise patent quality, which are the right countries to collaborate with? And third, does cooperation with partners located in a tax haven affect patent quality? The empirical methodology relies on forward citations as an indicator of quality, and patent co-ownership as a measure of international collaboration. Our econometric findings show that, first, the average effect of international collaboration is a 4.9% increase in patent quality compared with those patents for which the assignees come from a single country (once we controlled for patent characteristics). When the number of countries in which the assignees are based increases, the effect of this wider collaboration on patent quality is also greater, though only for up to a maximum of five countries. Second, to produce patents of better quality, the most suitable countries with which to collaborate were found to be the United States, Switzerland, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. Finally, collaboration with firms located in a country categorized as a tax haven does not have any significant impact on patent quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Collaborative Patent; International Collaboration; Patent Quality; Pharmaceutical Industry","","","","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Consejería de Economía, Innovación, Ciencia y Empleo, Junta de Andalucía [grant number SEJ-295].

Modern Corporate Governance Strategies for Sustainable Value Creation responds to the demand for a new paradigm in corporate governance, reflecting the challenges posed by the era of new organizational and managerial dynamics outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Responding to these challenges, a new approach is evolving in the area of corporate governance, one that puts the emphasis on creating sustainable value.

It introduces the record of these failures and illuminates hard lessons spread across thousands of empirical studies. If we look at the outcomes generated by various corporate governance ‘best’; practices, we find that none of the practices work. If we look at the theories and assumptions that support modern corporate governance, we find they are likely wrong. And if we look at the prospect of corporate governance to improve political, environmental, and social outcomes, we find ample evidence that governance will fail us here too.

Investors who are influenced by emotions may copy the actions of others, resulting in collective decision-making that can amplify market trends. This phenomenon is further influenced by cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and overconfidence, which can cloud judgment and lead to irrational excitement or panic selling. Understanding these psychological mechanisms is essential for investors and market analysts alike, as it provides insights into the dynamics of market behavior and contributes to more informed investment strategies and risk management practices. Psychological Drivers of Herding and Market Overreaction explores the psychological factors that drive herding behavior and market overreaction in financial markets. It integrates key psychological theories with financial market analysis to explain why investors follow the crowd and how these collective behaviors impact market stability.

This study uses data collected manually from the annual reports of the publicly listed non-financial firms from eleven Sub-Saharan Africa countries. The dependent variable of this study is corporate governance compliance index which is measured by the level of compliance with corporate governance practices. To obtain the index, the study constructed an unweighted corporate governance index based on various dimensions of good corporate governance practices existing in the literature and recommended by different corporate governance codes. The independent variable of this study is board diversity which is proxied by nationality and gender of the board members and represented by foreign directors and female directors in the boards, respectively. The data are analysed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression methods. More specifically, the Fractional Probit Regression method is utilised to analyse a 5-year unbalanced panel data set of 531 firm‐year observations to examine the effect of board diversity on corporate governance compliance. The findings indicate that both the percentage and inclusion of foreign directors on the boards improve corporate governance compliance. However, a relatively high percentage of foreign directors on the boards may be detrimental to corporate governance compliance. Moreover, the findings indicate that the percentage of female directors on the board is positive but not significantly related to corporate governance compliance. Similarly, the inclusion of female directors on the board has a positive but marginal significant relationship with corporate governance compliance only if the analysis model includes foreign directors as a control variable. These findings are especially useful for policy on the composition of the boards in Sub-Saharan Africa countries and other developing countries, mainly because the results suggest that foreign directors can help firms to enhance corporate governance compliance. However, there is a critical threshold of the number of foreign directors to include on the board, beyond which any additional increase of foreign directors may negatively affect corporate governance compliance. The findings emphasise the importance of board diversity, that is, an effective board should comprise foreign and domestic directors in a certain optimal proportion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Diversity; Corporate Governance Compliance; Female Directors; Foreign Directors; Sub-saharan Africa","","","","","Adams, Renée B., Women on boards: The superheroes of tomorrow?, Leadership Quarterly, 27, 3, pp. 371-386, (2016); Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Adams, Renée B., Beyond the glass ceiling: Does gender matter?, Management Science, 58, 2, pp. 219-235, (2012); African Economic Outlook 2016 Sustainable Cities and Structural Transformation, (2025); Aguilera, Ruth, Global corporate governance: On the relevance of firms' ownership structure, Journal of World Business, 51, 1, pp. 50-57, (2016); Al Amosh, Hamzeh, Corporate governance and voluntary disclosure of sustainability performance: the case of Jordan, SN Business and Economics, 1, 12, (2021); Al Amosh, Hamzeh, ESG performance in the time of COVID-19 pandemic: cross-country evidence, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 14, pp. 39978-39993, (2023); Alhassan, Abdulkareem, Weak economic institutions in Africa: a destiny or design?, International Journal of Social Economics, 46, 7, pp. 904-919, (2019); Euromed Journal of Business, (2023); Aluko, Olufemi Adewale, On the macroeconomic determinants of financial institutions development in sub-Saharan Africa, International Review of Economics, 67, 1, pp. 69-85, (2020)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629399","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000778118"

The findings demonstrate that open innovation through cross-border M&A has a positive effect on the upside potential and a negative effect on the downside risk of firm performance. Additionally, absorptive capacity and corporate governance play significant moderating roles in shaping the real options value of open innovation through cross-border M&A. These findings are robust across alternative measures of real options value and open innovation investments, sample classification based on institutional distance, and endogeneity tests. The research implies that cross-border M&A, particularly in countries with a favourable innovation environment, plays a crucial role in strengthening firm performance.

Our empirical analysis discloses multiple imperative findings. First, the period of high dependence between oil and these DJSI assets seems to be restricted to only at higher frequency (128–256 days). As such, DJSI Europe, US, Asia-pacific, and Korea show the strongest dependence with oil in the long run. However, this inter-relationship is only visible from 2018 onwards. Second, across the dependency spectrum and at multiple frequencies, the link between DJSI indices and gold is minimal. Third, when comparing a benchmark portfolio with a blended portfolio composed of a suitability index with gold/oil, in consistency with the hedging ratios results, the utility gain is remarkably better in the sustainability/gold pairing.

Using green patent data of Chinese listed companies, this paper tests the influence of EID on green innovation (GI) and the regulating role of digital transformation. Results show that EID has a positive impact on GI and that the relationship is significantly influenced by corporate digital transformation. Additionally, the moderating effect of digital transformation is more significant with high information opacity, financing dependence, and social attention. This study contributes to the literature on the perspective of firm-level voluntary information disclosure and proposes a more comprehensive logical analysis framework for the effect of EID on GI. Moreover, digital transformation can assist companies in identifying and disclosing environmental information more accurately, which increases the effectiveness of EID.

Using a sample of A-share listed firms from the heavily polluting industries in China during 2008 to 2016, we conduct correlation analysis, OLS regression, and Tobit regression methods and find that institutional investors' shareholdings are positively correlated with the quality of EID. When institutional investors increase 1% shareholdings of the firm, the EID quality improves by 0.03%. In addition, the high concentration of institutional ownership enhances the impact of institutional investors' shareholdings on the EID quality. But this positive correlation is only observed in companies in regions with a high marketization level. Our paper extends the research on the influential factors of EID and improves the understanding of the impact of institutional investors on corporate environmental behavior. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Information Disclosures; Institutional Investors’ Shareholdings; Ownership Concentration; Industrial Emission; Institutional Framework; Market Conditions; Ownership; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Stakeholder; China","industrial emission; institutional framework; market conditions; ownership; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; China","","","","Akins, Brian K., Investor competition over information and the pricing of information asymmetry, Accounting Review, 87, 1, pp. 35-58, (2012); Borochin, Paul A., The effects of institutional investor objectives on firm valuation and governance, Journal of Financial Economics, 126, 1, pp. 171-199, (2017); Chen, Tao, Institutional shareholders and corporate social responsibility, Journal of Financial Economics, 135, 2, pp. 483-504, (2020); Cheng, Zhihua, Will Corporate Political Connection Influence the Environmental Information Disclosure Level?

Findings: This paper finds that C2M announcements own a positive impact on the stock returns of supply chain firms. Further, the results show that the business and financial characteristics play a significant impact on the relationship between the C2M mode and firm stock return performance. For example, C2M mode leads to huge stock returns when firms cooperate with the platforms related to their business content. In addition, the business scope can strengthen the positive promotion of C2M mode in stock returns, while business concentration weakens the positive promotion of C2M mode in stock returns.

Developed and developing countries are currently pursuing trade openness to achieve higher bank performance with less intermediation costs.

The authors tested the hypothesis on data of 885 banks from BRICS countries, which span 18 years (2000–2017). Findings: The results from this robust study showed that embedding higher trade openness reduces financial intermediation costs and improves banks' performance. The results remain robust following the use of different estimation methods and alternative variables as proxies. In addition, results were still valid upon considering bank level, industry level and country level as control variables. It was also observed that the relation pattern holds its rigidity during “good” and “bad” times (i.e. the global financial crisis).

Design/methodology/approach: Event study, financial ratio and efficient frontier analyses with a mixture of parametric and non-parametric tests are used for the sample period 2016Q1–2022Q4. Findings: Event study analysis shows that merging banks (bidders) have higher positive cumulative abnormal returns than merged banks (targets), indicating that investors believe that bidding banks will benefit the most from the merger strategy. It was also found that the efficiency measures of the combined banks of Saudi British Bank and Alawwal Bank deteriorated, while they improved for the combined banks of National Commercial Bank and Saudi American Bank in the post-merger period, confirming investors' views. Research limitations/implications: Although the study focuses on the Saudi banking sector, its findings could be generalized to other banks in the region, as the Saudi banking sector is one of the largest in the Middle East region and is expected to grow further in the future. Practical implications: The mere act of merging two banks does not guarantee the realization of cost synergies or efficiency gains.

The interaction effect between risk factors and Islamic banks suggests that the lower the risk, the lower the returns for Islamic banks in MENA. This means Islamic banks in MENA face higher risks of generating higher returns. The sensitivity of Islamic banks comes from the extra supervision and regulation they face compared to their counterparts.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 990 listed firms in France from 2010 to 2020 to test the theoretical predictions. A random effect regression and two-stage least squares estimators are used to test the relationships. The results are largely robust across a number of econometric models that take into account diverse kinds of endogeneities. Findings: This study reveals that VD and CG are positively associated with firm value. The finding also indicates that VD and CG work together as substitutes rather than as complements. Furthermore, the author’s evidence suggests that ownership structure and CEO characteristics are substitutive with VD in their effect on firm value. This evidence is consistent with the view that VD can add value to the firm but only under a number of conditions. Practical implications: The results shed further light on how a firm could improve its value among stakeholders by designing VD and CG practices effectively. Specifically, as VD generally acts as a substitute to CG, to accomplish their optimal economic outcomes, firms need to be discerning in executing VD and governance practices. In addition, firms have strategic flexibility in constructing VD and governance practices contingent on their own settings. Policymakers, investors and managers could use these results to examine CG and VD practices in France following the implementation of new regulations. Originality/value: This study extends and contributes to the mixed or equivocal evidence of the relationships between VD, CG mechanisms and firm value. It contributes to the extant literature by first providing additional evidence, which suggests value-increasing effects of better-governed and more transparent firms. Second, this study reconciles extant disparate results by suggesting that VD can substitute CG in improving firm value. These findings have profound implications for policymakers, investors and firm’s managers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complements; Corporate Governance; Firm Value; France; Substitutes; Voluntary Disclosure","","","","The author gratefully acknowledges the insightful and timely suggestions by the Editor-in-Chief, Professor Philippe Gugler, and two anonymous reviewers.

Drawing on a dataset of Chinese A-share listed companies spanning 2008 to 2020, this research delves into the repercussions of economic policy uncertainty on the green technological pursuits of manufacturing firms and elucidates the underlying dynamics at play. The empirical evidence underscores a marked reluctance among companies to champion green technological innovation in the face of economic policy ambiguity, a stance that holds water even after rigorous robustness checks. Delving into the mechanisms, the study pinpoints heightened financial constraints and a diminishing risk appetite within the managerial ranks as pivotal deterrents steering firms away from green innovation projects amidst such uncertainty. Intriguingly, the adverse interplay between economic policy uncertainty and green innovation is especially accentuated in firms marked by tenuous government–business affiliations, pronounced monopolistic inclinations, lax intellectual property safeguards, minimal pollution footprints, and a skewed labor-to-capital composition. This investigation augments the scholarly discourse on the nexus between economic policy volatility and corporate green innovation, shedding light on strategic imperatives for emerging economies as they chart out future environmental blueprints and cultivate a conducive milieu for green innovation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Policy Uncertainty; Financing Constraints; Green Technology Innovation; Green Transition; Management Risk Appetite","","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72204099), the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund of the Ministry of Education of China (21YJC790021), the Philosophy and Social Sciences Excellent Innovation Team Construction Foundation of Jiangsu Province (SJSZ2020-20), and the National Social Science Fund: Research on the Formation Mechanism of China’s Urban Economic Resilience under the New Development Pattern (22FYB010).","Rasmussen, Kasper Dalgas, Platinum Demand and Potential Bottlenecks in the Global Green Transition: A Dynamic Material Flow Analysis, Environmental Science and Technology, 53, 19, pp. 11541-11551, (2019); Hickel, Jason E., Is Green Growth Possible?, New Political Economy, 25, 4, pp. 469-486, (2020); Schiederig, Tim, Green innovation in technology and innovation management - an exploratory literature review, R and D Management, 42, 2, pp. 180-192, (2012); Rennings, Klaus, Redefining innovation - Eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics, Ecological Economics, 32, 2, pp. 319-332, (2000); Qi, Guoyou, The drivers for contractors' green innovation: An industry perspective, Journal of Cleaner Production, 18, 14, pp. 1358-1365, (2010); Chen, Chentung, A fuzzy approach for supplier evaluation and selection in supply chain management, International Journal of Production Economics, 102, 2, pp. 289-301, (2006); Tseng, Ming Lang, Evaluating firm's green supply chain management in linguistic preferences, Journal of Cleaner Production, 40, pp. 22-31, (2013); Tan, Yafei, The effect of ESG rating events on corporate green innovation in China: The mediating role of financial constraints and managers' environmental awareness, Technology in Society, 68, (2022); Bosetti, Valentina, What should we expect from innovation?

We used a final sample of 106 SBF-listed firms during six years. To assess the effect of the crisis, we divided this period into three subperiods: pre-crisis (2016–2018), pandemic period (2019–2021), and all periods (2016–2021). A System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) is used to deal with the problem of endogeneity caused by the lagged dependent variable. The results showed that only the crisis and the financial constraints (KZ index) negatively correlated with dividend payment levels (DivPaid). This dividend level did not take performance into account. Regarding the control variables, only debt, growth, and size positively impacted dividend levels. Moreover, the performance of French companies was negatively influenced by the DividPaid, KZindex, and Crisis variables. The findings suggest that France should prioritize dividend payments to protect a company's reputation and financial health. These findings have significant implications for investors, financial analysts, regulators, and policymakers who are looking for guidance on dividend policy in uncertain situations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19 Pandemic; Crisis; Dividend Policy; Financial Constraints; Performance; Sbf120","","","","This finding is also supported by the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test.

This study investigates the impact of media attention on corporate environmental governance from 2011 to 2021, using China’s public companies as our samples. The empirical results indicate that media attention consistently and significantly enhances corporate environmental governance. This effect remains robust across endogeneity considerations and alternative tests. Additionally, in regions with higher marketization and stronger rule of law frameworks, the efficacy of media attention in improving corporate environmental performance becomes remarkably pronounced. Further analysis unveils that media attention positively impacts environmental governance by elevating public awareness, refining internal management efficiency, and fostering innovative strategies for minimizing environmental impact.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BLR on this topic. It aims to map the evolution of the literature, identifying the leading sources of knowledge in terms of the most influential journals, articles, and authors. It also provides a chronological development of the conceptual and intellectual structures of the networks in this topical research area. Using the Scopus database, the study identifies 2920 articles on the application of high-frequency intraday data in finance. These had been published in 393 journals during the period from 1977 to 2019. A thorough content analysis of the 100 most influential papers (ranked based on average citations per year) is also provided concerning research attributes in terms of datasets, asset classes, country of analysis and the major themes and sub-themes of these papers. The Journal of Banking and Finance is the leading journal in terms of the number of publications, whereas the Journal of Finance is the leading journal in terms of citations received on this topic. Tim Bollerslev is the leading author in this area in terms of the total number of publications (36), total citations (7241) and h-index (30). The most cited article in terms of total citations and average citations per year is Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Labys (2003) titled “Modeling and forecasting realized volatility”, which has appeared in Econometrica. The majority of the top 100 surveyed papers are empirical (66%). Volatility modeling as a major theme is the front runner with 29% of the surveyed papers. The theme “Volatility modeling” has most often been studied with Realized Volatility. The Trade and Quote (TAQ) database and 5-minute interval data appear to be the most favored choices in terms of data usage in high-frequency finance research. 56% of the surveyed papers have used the data on stocks, with NYSE stocks being the most popular, while US financial markets are the most commonly studied markets (65%). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithm Trading; Bibliometric Literature Review; Citation Analysis; High-frequency Data; Intraday","","","","","Review of Financial Studies, (1988); Ahmad, Nisar, Citation-based systematic literature review of energy-growth nexus: An overview of the field and content analysis of the top 50 influential papers, Energy Economics, 86, (2020); Ahmad, Nisar, SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW OF TOURISM GROWTH NEXUS: AN OVERVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AND A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PAPERS, Journal of Economic Surveys, 34, 5, pp. 1068-1110, (2020); Ahmad, Nisar, BANKING SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROFITABILITY, AND EFFICIENCY: A CITATION-BASED SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW, Journal of Economic Surveys, 34, 1, pp. 185-218, (2020); Andersen, Torben G., Heterogeneous information arrivals and return volatility dynamics: Uncovering the long-run in high frequency returns, Journal of Finance, 52, 3, pp. 975-1005, (1997); Andersen, Torben G., Deutsche mark-dollar volatility: Intraday activity patterns, macroeconomic announcements, and longer run dependencies, Journal of Finance, 53, 1, pp. 219-265, (1998); Andersen, Torben G., Roughing it up: Including jump components in the measurement, modeling, and forecasting of return volatility, Review of Economics and Statistics, 89, 4, pp. 701-720, (2007); Andersen, Torben G., The distribution of realized stock return volatility, Journal of Financial Economics, 61, 1, pp. 43-76, (2001); Andersen, Torben G., Modeling and forecasting realized volatility, Econometrica, 71, 2, pp. 579-625, (2003); Andersen, Torben G., Real-time price discovery in global stock, bond and foreign exchange markets, Journal of International Economics, 73, 2, pp. 251-277, (2007)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","10575219","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165702068"

Our findings are as follows. First, a large number of the existing studies are descriptive and/or draw on single rather than multi-theoretical perspectives. Second, existing studies have focused mainly on how CSR is related to financial performance measures to the neglect of non-financial performance measures.

However, M&A decisions are de jure and de facto not only influenced by a single person, the CEO, but by a group of individuals, namely the board of directors. In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent the overconfidence of board directors affects key acquisition outcomes. Building on the overconfidence literature, we argue that board directors become overconfident through biased self-attribution in recent M&A deals and hypothesize that their overconfidence leads to poorer subsequent M&A outcomes.

The findings reveal that independent commissioners and board size have significant positive effects on firm value, while the Corporate Governance Perception Index (CGPI) is not significant. Additionally, the study demonstrates that firm size significantly influences firm value. Earnings manipulation is found to mediate the relationship between corporate governance, firm size, and firm value.

The board of directors is under pressure to represent the interests of every stakeholder. The purpose of this study is to analyze and compare the impact of board diversity on corporate social responsibility and sustainability in the U.S. and Australian non-financial sectors. In this vein, very first time current study, develop an index score for board diversity and sustainable development for both economies. In addition, the study also examines the influence of gender diversity, cultural diversity and diversity of experience on CSR and sustainable development in the two countries. Sample of non-financial sectors embedded from the S&P 1500 Index and the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) for the periods 2010 to 2020. Results are estimated based on Panel regression models and dynamic GMM. The results of the study show that, on average, corporate social responsibility and sustainable development in the United States are superior to those in Australia. The ASX Diversity Index score has a significant and positive impact on CSR funds and the Sustainability Index. However, in the USA, the Board Diversity Index only impacts CSR funds. Moreover, directors with diverse cultural background in Australian firms are highly promoting sustainable development than US ones. However, cultural diversity on US boards strongly favors CSR practices compared to their Australian counterparts. While the presence of women on the board of directors contributes positively to local CSR activities and has a negative impact on global development in both countries. In addition, the experience of the US Board of Directors has suggested more funding for community development rather than sustainable development. The results of the study make significant contributions to academics and policymakers for U.S. and Australian stock exchanges. To develop CSR practices at the national level and sustainable development at the global level, the American and Australian Security Exchange Commission needs to take initiatives through the deployment of diversified boards of directors. Based on the findings, current study supports the stakeholder theory, Upper Echelon theory and cultural trait theory. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Diversity Mechanism; Csr; Cultural Diversity; Sustainability Development; Economic And Social Effects; Financial Markets; Regression Analysis; 'current; Australia; Australian Stock Exchanges; Board Diversity Mechanism; Boards Of Directors; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Cultural Diversity; Financial Sectors; Sustainability Development; Sustainable Development","Economic and social effects; Financial markets; Regression analysis; 'current; Australia; Australian stock exchanges; Board diversity mechanism; Boards of directors; Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Cultural diversity; Financial sectors; Sustainability development; Sustainable development","","","","Deakin Law Review, (2015); Adams, Carol A., Connecting the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and calls for ‘harmonisation’ of sustainability reporting, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 82, (2022); Adams, Dawda, Globalisation, governance, accountability and the natural resource ‘curse’: Implications for socio-economic growth of oil-rich developing countries, Resources Policy, 61, pp. 128-140, (2019); Mohamed Adnan, Shayuti, The influence of culture and corporate governance on corporate social responsibility disclosure: A cross country analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 198, pp. 820-832, (2018); Aggarwal, Raj, Board diversity and firm performance: The role of business group affiliation, International Business Review, 28, 6, (2019); Al-Mamun, Abdullah, Board of director attributes and CSR engagement in emerging economy firms: Evidence from across Asia, Emerging Markets Review, 46, (2021); Aladwey, Laila Mohamed Alshawadfy, Attributes of corporate boards and assurance of corporate social responsibility reporting: evidence from the UK, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 22, 4, pp. 748-780, (2022); Alizadeh, Amin, The Drivers and Barriers of Corporate Social Responsibility: A Comparison of the MENA Region and Western Countries, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2022); Amini, Chiara, Corporate social responsibility and Latin American firm performance, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 17, 3, pp. 403-445, (2017); Amorelli, María Florencia, Critical mass of female directors, human capital, and stakeholder engagement by corporate social reporting, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 1, pp. 204-221, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166004219"

Previous studies have mainly focused on the impact of formal institutions, such as ecological tax and environmental regulations, on green innovation, while the role of informal institutions has been largely overlooked. This study investigates whether social dishonesty is a crucial factor that inhibits corporate green innovation, using defaulted executors announced by the Supreme People's Court of China between 2013 and 2019 as a research sample. The findings indicate that social dishonesty significantly inhibits enterprises’ green innovation, even after conducting robustness tests. Mechanistic tests reveal that social dishonesty impairs green innovation by exacerbating firms’ financing constraints, increasing the cost of debt, and lowering their ESG scores. The study also shows that the negative impact of social dishonesty on enterprises’ green innovation is more significant for non-state firms and those with irregularities, while non-negative media coverage and government environmental subsidies effectively mitigate this effect. Therefore, this study highlights the vital role of informal institutions in shaping firms’ green innovation behavior, particularly in emerging markets and regions committed to green development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Defaulted Executors; Green Innovation; Informal Institutions; Social Dishonesty","","","","Government environmental subsidies may function as a moderating factor on the impact of social dishonesty on corporate green innovation. According to resource dependence theory, external resources such as government subsidies can effectively guide and drive the green innovation of enterprises. Government environmental subsidies provide non-repayable financial support to enterprises, directly increasing the available funds. It can help reduce financing pressure and R&D risks companies face amidst a socially dishonest environment, boosting their confidence in pursuing green innovation. Furthermore, government environmental subsidies can signal recognition and support for corporate growth potential, enhancing the confidence of external investors and other stakeholders in these corporates. It, in turn, attracts additional financial resources and technical talent to the enterprise, promoting green innovation.","Aghion, Philippe, The unequal effects of liberalization: Evidence from dismantling the license raj in India, American Economic Review, 98, 4, pp. 1397-1412, (2008); Aghion, Philippe, Carbon taxes, path dependency, and directed technical change: Evidence from the auto industry, Journal of Political Economy, 124, 1, pp. 1-51, (2016); Aghion, Philippe, Innovation and institutional ownership, American Economic Review, 103, 1, pp. 277-304, (2013); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Allen, Franklin, Law, finance, and economic growth in China, Journal of Financial Economics, 77, 1, pp. 57-116, (2005); Amir, Amel Zadeh, Why and how investors use ESG information: Evidence from a global survey, Financial Analysts Journal, 74, 3, pp. 87-103, (2018); Berrone, Pascual, Necessity as the mother of 'green' inventions: Institutional pressures and environmental innovations, Strategic Management Journal, 34, 8, pp. 891-909, (2013); Biggart, Nicole Woolsey, Collateralized social relations: The social in economic calculation, American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 60, 2, pp. 471-500, (2001); Cabon-Dhersin, Marie Laure, Does trust matter for R&D cooperation?

The ANN models are compared against traditional econometric models for ten Asian markets using daily data for the time period from 12 September 1994 to 05 March 2018. The empirical results indicate that ML algorithms, across the range of countries, can better approximate dependencies compared to traditional benchmark models. Notably, the predictive performance of such deep learning models is superior perhaps due to its ability in capturing long-range dependencies. For example, the Neuro Fuzzy models of ANFIS and CANFIS, which outperform the EGARCH model, are more flexible in modelling both asymmetry and long memory properties. This offers new insights for Asian markets. In addition to standard statistics forecast metrics, we also consider risk management measures including the value-at-risk (VaR) average failure rate, the Kupiec LR test, the Christoffersen independence test, the expected shortfall (ES) and the dynamic quantile test. The study concludes that ML algorithms provide improving volatility forecasts in the stock markets of Asia and suggest that this may be a fruitful approach for risk management. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Es; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Var; Volatility","","","","","Journal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences, (2012); Ahamed, S.

This paper aims to explore this issue by studying the implementation of BEM in Indonesian State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in 2013–2019 (t). More specifically, we analyze the relationship between the BEM in the current year (t) and the financial performance in the previous year (2012–2018/t-1) and the following year (2014–2020/t+1) using non-financial performance as a mediating variable. This method is intended to discover whether measuring the results for the current year considers the company's performance from the previous year and stimulates progress in the following year. This quantitative study is based on a sample of 174 firms and 3654 observational data points. Employing partial least square–path modeling (PLS-PM), we find that BEM deployment is strongly related to non-financial performance as measured by corporate social responsibility activities, customer satisfaction, workforce quality, and total productivity. Nevertheless, this relationship does not predict financial success for the company, as measured by profitability, financial leverage risk, and shareholder return. Other findings indicate that the BEM on SOEs is not implemented properly, as evidenced by an unbalanced weight score between financial and non-financial performance, non-independent examiners, and political interests at the leadership level. Hence, SOEs are unlikely to gain financially from BEM deployment.

We find that economic growth induces stock and bond IPOs and that the issuers time offerings such that they coincide with favorable market conditions. Even though in 1873, regulation was abruptly relaxed, we find no evidence of increases in the number of IPOs.

While aimed at increasing a company’s efficiency and profitability, it often falls short of desired objectives, partly due to negative consequences for remaining employees, the so-called “survivors”. As workforce reductions may jeopardize a company’s legitimacy, we develop a model that links the change in post-restructuring employee productivity to the factors that help mitigate legitimacy issues. By using a comprehensive and innovative dataset of restructuring announcements reported by European companies over the post-crisis period, we analyze the moderating effect of the restructuring extent on the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and economic justification as legitimacy tools in counterbalancing the negative effects of job reduction measures. Our findings reveal that in reactive layoffs, induced by financial difficulties, initially high levels of CSR help lessen negative effects of restructuring on employee productivity in low-extent restructuring events; while in high-extent restructuring events employee productivity is supported by continuing investments in CSR. We provide evidence that both the level and dynamics of CSR practices play a significant role, and their effect on employee performance is conditional on the restructuring context. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","We would like to thank the editor and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments as well as the participants of EBEN 32nd Annual Conference and INSEEC U.

The empirical results suggest the existence of multiple digital tech bubbles, which are mostly accompanied by an excessive rise. However, the appearance of digital tech bubbles is curbed since 2016, mainly due to the increasing mature regulations in relevant fields. Besides, bubbles in different digital technologies are similar during the same period, which could be attributed to the close relationships among them. Additionally, we further investigate the factors influencing the explosive behaviours, and find that the Chinese stock market positively affects digital tech bubbles, while economic policy uncertainties and situations negatively influence such explosive behaviors. In the context of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, these conclusions provide valuable implications to achieve the target of constructing a “Digital China” by becoming moderately cautious about potential bubbles in the digital tech industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Digital Technology; Explosive Bubbles; Generalized Supremum Adf","","","","","Baker, Scott R., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Economic Policy Uncertainty in China, (2013); Caferra, Rocco, Bitcoin: Bubble that bursts or Gold that glitters?, Economics Letters, 205, (2021); Campello, Murillo, Do stock prices influence corporate decisions?

Design/methodology/approach: To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASEAN Islamic and conventional equities, first, the authors calculated the volatility by using exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity methodology and then used Wavelet methodology to see the co-movement between the volatility and returns of ASEAN equity market indicators and COVID-19 cases. Findings: The authors find that until the beginning of August, COVID-19 adversely relates to the returns of both the indices. The conventional index seemed to have increased volatility during the time period, whereas the Islamic index seemed to have declined volatility.

As concerns about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues continue to gain prominence, understanding the implications of sustainability efforts on firm performance becomes crucial. This study proposes an empirical exploration of how sustainability initiatives, embedded in ESG scores, undertaken by Fintech firms influence their market valuations. Moreover, the investigation contrasts the findings for the Fintech firms against those for their counterpart Technology firms for the period between 2011 and 2021. The results show that Technology firms are better valued than their Fintech counterparts, which might reflect a perception of higher risk for the later. By employing panel econometric techniques in the system-GMM setting, the paper finds that capital market investors include ESG factors in their valuation of Fintech and Techinology companies, but the environmental and governance-related initiatives at corporate level are most important in this process.

The empirical investigation is carried out in the context of the elastic-net regularization (ENET) approach and dynamic simulations of the autoregressive distributed lag (DYNARDL) model, with proper consideration to the potential presence of structural changes. From among 26 candidate variables, the ENET selects the clean technology market, public attention to clean energy, oil, and gold as the primary factors contributing the most to the behavior of clean-energy stock prices. The estimation results of the DYNARDL model suggest that the clean technology market and oil are vital determinants in the short and long run, while public attention and gold tend to affect clean-energy stock prices only in the short run. Furthermore, the respective magnitudes of influence of the four variables are larger in the short term than in the long term.

Credit rating models have been developed using a variety of statistical and machine learning methods. These methods, however, are data-intensive and dependent on assumptions about data distribution. This research offers an integrated fuzzy credit rating model to address such issues. This study proposes an integrated fuzzy credit rating model to reduce such problems. The study applies the fuzzy best–worst method (fuzzy-BWM) to obtain the weight of criteria that affect creditworthiness and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy-TOPSIS)-Sort-C to evaluate the borrowers. The BWM was found consistent amongst existing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, and consistency further improves when BWM is extended to a fuzzy version. The study applies TOPSIS-Sorting along with fuzzy theory to overcome human uncertainty while making a decision. TOPSIS-sorting has been found capable of handling rank reversal problems that persist in the TOPSIS method. The fuzzy-TOPSIS-Sort-C method is applied to evaluate borrowers based on the characteristic profile of the identified criteria. The proposed model's efficacy has been illustrated with a case study to rate fifty firms with real-life data. The proposed model results are compared with previous studies and commercially available ratings. The model results show better accuracy in terms of accuracy and true-positive rates to predict default. It can help financial institutions to find potential borrowers for granting credit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Best–worst Method; Credit Rating Model; Fuzzy Set Theory; Topsis-sort-c","","","","","Moon, Tae-hee, Technology credit rating system for funding SMEs, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 62, 4, pp. 608-615, (2011); Wang, Mingfu, Utilizing historical data for corporate credit rating assessment, Expert Systems with Applications, 165, (2021); Zhang, Faming, Corporate credit-risk evaluation system: Integrating explicit and implicit financial performances, International Journal of Production Economics, 177, pp. 77-100, (2016); Ala’raj, Maher, A new hybrid ensemble credit scoring model based on classifiers consensus system approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 64, pp. 36-55, (2016); Chavira, Diego Alonso Gastélum, A credit ranking model for a parafinancial company based on the ELECTRE-III method and a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, Applied Soft Computing, 60, pp. 190-201, (2017); International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards A Revised Framework, (2004); Bai, Chunguang, Banking credit worthiness: Evaluating the complex relationships, Omega (United Kingdom), 83, pp. 26-38, (2019); Ju, Yonghan, Updating a credit-scoring model based on new attributes without realization of actual data, European Journal of Operational Research, 234, 1, pp. 119-126, (2014); Shi, Baofeng, A novel imbalanced data classification approach based on logistic regression and fisher discriminant, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2015, (2015); Hwang, Rueyching, Predicting issuer credit ratings using a semiparametric method, Journal of Empirical Finance, 17, 1, pp. 120-137, (2010)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","21994536; 21986053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136575244"

This research study relies on secondary data collected from annual reports of 100 companies covering 8 years, from 2010 to 2017, using manual content analysis. Fifty non-financial listed companies from each emerging market were selected; the selection is based on the market capitalization. Findings from countries’ dummy indicate that Indian companies perform better in corporate governance practices than Gulf countries. Moreover, corporate governance practices negatively impact Indian and Gulf countries’ firms’ performance measured by return on assets (ROA), except for governance effectiveness (GE) that has a positive impact. In contrast, corporate governance measured by board structure (BS) is negatively affected by the performance of Indian and Gulf countries’ listed companies measured by Tobin’s Q (TQ), whereas transparency and disclosure (TD), leverage (LEV) and GE have a positive impact. The results have implications for managers and policyholders to understand the corporate governance practices and their relationships with performance.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is quantitative using a sample of 467 public firms in Indonesia. Data were analyzed into statistics descriptive and the hypothesis was tested using the test of logistic regression. Findings: The preliminary results of the paper demonstrate the number of firms employing women and men in the structure of corporate governance of 13% on the commissioner board, 7% on the director board and 5% on the audit committee. Based on the test of effect, this paper further found that firms employing women and men (gender diversity) in the structure of the board of commissioners, tend to suffer from financial distress lower than firms only employing men (non-gender diversity). Research limitations/implications: This paper is not an effort to make the proportion of voices of women equal to men, however the representation of women at least exists in the structure of corporate governance as part of workforce diversity and inclusivity. In addition, this paper is considered not to use panel data with the purpose of avoiding repetitive data because of the use of a nominal scale in the logistic regression model. Practical implications: The finding of the paper is addressed to deliver insights into the current conversation on the issue of women's day with the theme of Each for Equal and to firms in positioning women in the structure of boardrooms. Originality/value: This paper extends the limited scholarly work on the nexus between gender diversity and financial performance.

This paper examines the influence of the board of directors’ and chief executive officers’ (CEO) characteristics on the profitability of banks in Serbia. In this study, the characteristics of boards of directors were examined in terms of size and the participation of women, and the characteristics of CEOs were examined similarly in terms of women’s participation. The research was conducted on a sample of 23 commercial banks from Serbia in the period from 2017 to 2021. Profitability was measured by the rate of return on operating assets (ROA) and the rate of return on equity (ROE). The results of the panel regression analysis indicate that the size of the board of directors had a positive impact on bank profitability during the COVID-19 pandemic period, while this impact was not statistically significant before the pandemic. The participation of women on the board of directors did not have a statistically significant impact on bank profitability before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been found that the participation of women as CEOs had a negative impact on bank profitability before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banks; Board Of Directors; Business Viability; Chief Executive Officer (ceo); Covid-19; Profitability; Serbia; Size Of The Board Of Directors; Women’s Participation As Ceos; Women’s Participation On Boards Of Directors; Business Development; Corporate Strategy; Covid-19; Equity; Gender; Participatory Approach; Profitability; Regression Analysis; Womens Organization; Serbia","business development; corporate strategy; COVID-19; equity; gender; participatory approach; profitability; regression analysis; womens organization; Serbia","","","","Hotel Tour Manag, (2021); Hotel and Tourism Management, (2022); Bizinfo Blace J Econ Manag Inform, (2022); Bankarstvo Banking, (2022); Our Econ, (2023); Industrija, (2012); Journal of Money and Business, (2023); (2022); Facta Universitatis Series Economics and Organization, (2020); Habtoor, Omer Saeed, Board Attributes and Bank Performance in Light of Saudi Corporate Governance Regulations, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 15, 10, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165097769"

Since global warming has caught the attention of researchers and authorities, environmental issues are receiving more attention. In this vein, the pressure of sustainable development goals explains the status of corporate sustainable development. Particularly, corporate green practices including green innovation and green total factor productivity have become hot topics. Therefore, how green innovation can be beneficial to green total factor productivity is a major point of concern in this study. For that, corporate factors such as the role of board capital are a new light for developing green innovation. Moreover, this study also takes the competition factor into account for green innovation. This study considers agency theory and the Porter hypothesis as the theoretical base, and the results give distinctive conclusions by using fixed effects, generalized moments methods, and feasible generalized least squares on Chinese manufacturing corporations from 2011 to 2020. After a series of tests, we highlight the benefits of board capital, particularly human capital and social capital, that help to produce firm green innovation. Additionally, we explain that market competition compels corporations to make green innovations. Further, we importantly show that market competitiveness plays a critical role in fostering relationships between green innovation and board capital. It is crucial to note that by enhancing green innovation, the goal of green total factor production can be reached. These findings shed light on the imperative environmental concerns and can be a good example for authorities and governments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Capital; Green Innovation; Green Total Factor Productivity; Market Competition; Moderating Effect; Environmental Economics; Global Warming; Green Economy; Market Conditions; Sustainable Development; Total Factor Productivity","environmental economics; global warming; green economy; market conditions; sustainable development; total factor productivity","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the School of Management, Hunan City University, Yiyang, China.","Wu, Jing, Green innovation and enterprise green total factor productivity at a micro level: A perspective of technical distance, Journal of Cleaner Production, 344, (2022); Wang, Haoran, Effect of green technology innovation on green total factor productivity in China: Evidence from spatial durbin model analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 288, (2021); Huang, Weiqing, Review of recent progress of emission trading policy in China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 349, (2022); Lee, Chichuan, How does green finance affect green total factor productivity?

The results suggest that female participation on supervisory boards and executives tend to kerb real earnings management during bearish and bullish periods. Another important finding is that female CEOs are more cautious in real earnings manipulation due to their risk-averse nature during the bearish period, while female CFOs are more likely to constrain real earnings management in the bullish period.

Design/methodology/approach: A data set of 221 non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for 10 years (2008–2017) was analysed using panel-corrected standard error regression. Additionally, the authors address endogeneity issue by using Hackman two-stage estimation and lagged variables regression. Findings: The study found that PCs negatively affected the firm’s financial performance, and director efficacy as a moderator strengthened this relationship. The result is consistent with the political economy theory that argues that an unstable political system and a weak judicial system will strongly affect investors and their rights. Practical implications: The impact of political influence on the corporate sector remains a concern for policymakers, regulators, investors, financial experts, auditors and academic researchers. This study’s findings are that an effective board of directors can strengthen the company’s best practices by controlling political connectedness to protect all the interested parties, particularly investors, and restore their confidence. Therefore, the results of this study can assist all stakeholders when a PCs exists to make the right decisions. Originality/value: The study extends the literature in terms of theoretical contribution that uses an integrative approach to combine political economy theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory to address the moderating role of director efficacy with an association between PCs and firm financial performance. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no extant research has investigated the association between PCs and firm financial performance using five aspects of PCs, along with moderator director efficacy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Boardroom Effectiveness; Codes; Corporate Governance; Director Efficacy; Financial Performance; Political Connections; Political Economy; Political Economy Theory","","","","","Abdullah, Shamsul Nahar, Women directors, family ownership and earnings management in Malaysia, Asian Review of Accounting, 24, 4, pp. 525-550, (2016); Agrawal, Anup, Do some outside directors play a political role?, Journal of Law and Economics, 44, 1, pp. 179-198, (2001); Aguinis, Herman, Improving Our Understanding of Moderation and Mediation in Strategic Management Research, Organizational Research Methods, 20, 4, pp. 665-685, (2017); Agyei-Mensah, Ben Kwame, The impact of board characteristics on corporate investment decisions: an empirical study, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 21, 4, pp. 569-586, (2020); Future Business Journal, (2017); Abasyn Journal of Social Sciences, (2019); European Journal of Economics Finance and Administrative Sciences, (2015); Al-Absy, Mujeeb Saif Mohsen, Board chairmen’s involvement in the nomination and remuneration committees and earnings management, Australasian Accounting, Business and Finance Journal, 12, 4, pp. 60-76, (2018); International Journal of Business Human and Social Sciences, (2019); Al-Dhamari, Redhwan Ahmed Ali, The impact of political connection and risk committee on corporate financial performance: evidence from financial firms in Malaysia, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 20, 7, pp. 1281-1305, (2020)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","14720701","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150957673"

Motives for this trend are the subject of a large body of literature. This study incorporates farm size risk and return analysis into this research stream. In this paper, cross-sectional and temporal relations between farm size and returns are examined and characterized. Design/methodology/approach: Relying on farm level panel data from Kansas Farm Management Association (KFMA) for 140 farms from 1996 to 2018, this article examines the relationship between farm size and returns and investigates whether farm size is related to risk. Two measures of farm returns are used: excess return on equity and risk-adjusted return on equity. Value of farm production and total farm acres are used as measures of farm size. Findings: Findings suggest a significant and positive relationship between farm size and excess return on equity as well as farm size and risk-adjusted return on equity. However, this return premium associated with farm size is not associated with additional risk. Stated differently, farm size can be viewed as a farm characteristic that is associated with higher return without additional risk. Practical implications: These findings provide further support for ongoing farm consolidation. Originality/value: The results suggest the trend towards consolidation in production agriculture is likely to continue.

Mechanism tests indicate that SCIOCs help distressed firms through exiting the market, reducing bank loans, enhancing corporate governance, and improving operating efficiency. Heterogeneity tests show that the effect of SCIOC establishment is more significant in central and western regions, in public welfare and special function industries, for central SCIOCs, for state capital investing companies, when firms are organized in more layers, and for firms that engage in M&As.

Our paper considers the role of female board representation and its impact on open innovation (OI) in the unique context of emerging markets. We draw on upper echelons and institutional theories to understand how female board representation and cross-country institutional contexts influence coupled OI. Combining a 10-year (2009–2019) dataset with a rich in-depth content analysis of 183 (EMNEs) engaged in OI, our results reveal a significant positive association between female board representation and a firm's commitment to coupled OI initiatives. We also find that country-level institutional factors affect and positively moderate the relationship between female board representation and coupled OI. In emerging market environments where managerial perception and cultural beliefs sometimes hinder the promotion of females into top positions, our work has implications for EMNEs regarding how they harness diversity. We contribute to the OI literature by showing that female board representation enhances corporate OI investment within EMNEs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coupled Open Innovation (oi); Emerging Market Multinational Enterprises (emnes); Female Board Representation; Institutional Context; Commerce; Content Analysis; Coupled Open Innovation; Emerging Market Multinational Enterprise; Emerging Markets; Female Board Representation; Institutional Contexts; Institutional Theory; Multinational Enterprise; Open Innovation; Upper Echelons Theories; Investments","Commerce; Content analysis; Coupled open innovation; Emerging market multinational enterprise; Emerging markets; Female board representation; Institutional contexts; Institutional theory; Multinational enterprise; Open innovation; Upper echelons theories; Investments","","","Institutions include both formal (i.e., laws, rights, corruption regulations, government efficiency and effectiveness) and informal institutions (i.e., gender parity, culture, codes of conduct, local norms). Both formal and informal institutions are created and maintained to ensure social stability (North, 1991). It is worth noting that the institutional environment can constrain but also enable organisations’ actions, such as innovation, knowledge transfer, and OI (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Adams et al., 2019). Due to its openness, sharing, and collaboration nature, OI requires informal institutional support, such as a collectivist culture that encourages sharing and community building and customer or user willingness to co-develop. The OI process and its improvement also need a set of formal institutional support (Caraça et al., 2009). Collaborated innovation project success often takes place in a qualified institutional environment where the virtuous circle of innovation is more likely to be sustained (Greco et al., 2017).The baseline logit regression and our robust two-steps system GMM results in Table 6 show a significant positive association between female board representation and coupled OI in both our model 1 (β = 0.374, p < 0.013) and model 2 – system GMM regression-two-step (β = 0.553, p < 0.005) respectively. (please refer to Table 6, the p-values represent the standard errors of the regression co-efficient). This shows that our findings are robust and consistent across the logistic regression model and our robust two-step system GMM. This result supported hypothesis 1 and is consistent with the underpinning argument of the UET that having more female board members can exert a sizable positive influence on coupled OI activities. Besides, our results agree with scores of studies contending that having more females on corporate boards increases divergent views which enhances creativity and innovation (e.g., Ain et al., 2021; Yarram and Adapa, 2021; Espig et al., 2021; He and Jiang, 2019; Nadeem et al., 2020; Attah-Boakye et al., 2022Attah‐Boakye et al., 2022). Our results, therefore, imply that encouraging more females to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics and supporting and promoting them into top positions will contribute significantly to corporate innovation and reduction in Co2 emissions (Le Loarne-Lemaire et al., 2021). Our study extends the literature by providing empirical evidence that is based on data collected from 183 EMNEs operating in 16 emerging economies. Our results imply that legislation that supports the promotion of more females to the board can positively influence OI activities.To analyse hypothesis 2a, we test how the control of corruption moderates the effect of female board representation on coupled OI using our baseline logit regression in model 1 and robust two-steps system GMM results in model 2 (please see Table 7). Our results revealed that control corruption positively moderates the effects between female board representation and coupled OI (please refer to Table 7, model 1: β = 0.113, p < 0.126). and model 2 – system GMM regression-two-step (β = 0.112, p < 0.129) respectively This finding supports hypothesis 2a. This finding also corroborates with previous empirical studies that contend that, unlike their male counterparts, female board members in the upper echelons are usually less likely to engage in corrupt practices (Xia et al., 2018). Additionally, empirical studies such as Lee et al. (2020) and Pirtea et al. (2019) contend that although country-level institutional quality plays a vital role in firm-level innovation, poor institutional quality such as corruption and poor governance has a significant negative effect on OI. Our results imply that having more female board members will not only lessen corrupt practices but also strengthen coupled OI.To test hypothesis 2c, we included the WPI (also sometimes referred to as gender parity index) in our corpus of variables. The purpose is to investigate if higher WPI moderates the positive association between female board representation and coupled OI. Our model 1 baseline logit regression results in Table 7 revealed that higher female board members combined with WPI have a significant positive effect on coupled OI (β = 0.442, p < 0.020). Similarly, this significant result is supported by our robust two steps system GMM in model 2 in Table 7 (β = 0.450, p < 0.020). These interesting findings are consistent with hypothesis 2c and other studies such as who argue that women parity, diversity, inclusion, and equity are essential for knowledge production and corporate innovation. Besides, WPI has long been the central focus for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) international network organisations aimed at supporting female STEM education in most emerging economies. Our study provides new and interesting insights into the role of female board members.Although corporate governance codes spreading around the world elevates the role of the board to a supervisory role, it also requires an understanding of the strategic direction of firms. The influence of corporate boards on the strategic decisions of firms has been well explored over the years (e.g., Carpenter and Westphal, 2001; Judge Jr and Zeithaml, 1992; Luciano et al., 2020). The involvement of the board of directors in strategic decisions (whether they occupy an executive position or NEDs) can be viewed as an institutional response or as a strategic adaptation to external pressures on the firm. Given the recent intensification of external regulatory pressures on corporate accountability, it is difficult to assume that non-executive or outside directors will engage in rubber stamping exercises by supporting OI initiatives that require huge long-term commitment and investments. Therefore, whilst the role of board members (especially females) may not be so straight, our data analysis extends the literature by evidencing an unequivocal linkage between the engagement of females on corporate boards and coupled OI. Using the WPI and quantile regressions strengthens our position on how female board representation, directly and indirectly, increased OI initiatives which seem to also enhance firm performance.","Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Adams, Renée B., Beyond the glass ceiling: Does gender matter?, Management Science, 58, 2, pp. 219-235, (2012); Adams, Kweku, Causes of Financial FDI Inflows into Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): Evidence from Ghana, Thunderbird International Business Review, 56, 5, pp. 439-459, (2014); Adams, Dawda, The role of country-level institutional factors in escaping the natural resource curse: Insights from Ghana, Resources Policy, 61, pp. 433-440, (2019); Afrifa, Godfred A., Innovation input, governance and climate change: Evidence from emerging countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 161, (2020); Ahmad, Munir, Combined role of green productivity growth, economic globalization, and eco-innovation in achieving ecological sustainability for OECD economies, Journal of Environmental Management, 302, (2022); Ul Ain, Qurat Ul, The impact of board gender diversity and foreign institutional investors on firm innovation: evidence from China, European Journal of Innovation Management, 25, 3, pp. 813-837, (2022); Managing the Business Risks of Open Innovation, (2012); Anokhin, Sergey Alexander, Entrepreneurship, innovation, and corruption, Journal of Business Venturing, 24, 5, pp. 465-476, (2009); Arellano, Manuel, Some tests of specification for panel data:monte carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01664972","","TNVTD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151273489"

Among the different aspects that affect firm innovation, this aspect has been overlooked, even though it may play a crucial role, given the fact that CEOs are important decision-makers within firm boundaries. Therefore, in this study we address the following research question: What effect does the CEO's social capital have on corporate innovation? This study dissects the effects of CEO social capital into its internal and external dimensions, and it looks at related moderating effects. Grounding our study in social capital theory, using a sample of Chinese listed firms between 2007 and 2016, we propose and provide empirical evidence that both the internal and external social capital of CEOs play a critical role for the innovation of firms. In addition, we have also explored the boundary conditions of these effects, considering the way CEO duality and state ownership moderate the effects brought about by CEO internal and external social capital on corporate innovation. Our findings contribute to the scientific understanding of the conditions in which CEO social capital may benefit firm innovation to a greater extent, by also considering the effects of CEO duality and state ownership.

Findings show that GI can improve enterprise reputation, and it has a significant positive lag effect. Additionally, we compare the different effects of green patent applications and approved green patents. A possible mechanism is that GI reduces the pollution emission of enterprises. GI also performs better in improving the reputation of coastal enterprises, state-owned enterprises and large-scale enterprises, and old enterprises. Our finding on the causal relationship between GI and enterprise reputation is of great significance in further understanding the practical value of GI activities, and it has certain reference value for the policy formulation of governments and decision making of enterprises. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Enterprise Reputation; Green Innovation; Green Patent; Algorithm; Environmental Economics; Industrial Enterprise; Innovation; Regression Analysis; Sustainability; China","algorithm; environmental economics; industrial enterprise; innovation; regression analysis; sustainability; China","","","We thank the support provided by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (Grant No. 2021B1515020103).","Adegbile, Abiodun Samuel, Strategic foresight for innovation management: A review and research agenda, International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management, 14, 4, (2017); Ali, Salah Abdel Hafeez Mostafa, The impact of firm characteristics on corporate financial performance in emerging markets: Evidence from egypt, International Journal of Customer Relationship Marketing and Management, 11, 4, pp. 70-89, (2020); Alon, Anna, Sustainability performance and assurance: Influence on reputation, Corporate Reputation Review, 18, 4, pp. 337-352, (2015); Arenhardt, Daniel Luís, The influence of the green innovation in the search of competitive advantage of enterprises of the electrical and electronic brazilian sectors, International Journal of Innovation Management, 20, 1, (2016); Bahta, Dawit, How does CSR enhance the financial performance of SMEs?

Vietnam and many other ASEAN countries have gone through a period of privatization and equitization of wholly controlled SOEs, with the State retaining partial ownership in many privatized businesses. This book explains the dynamic relationships between the State, BODs, shareholders, and regulators and their influence on corporate governance and SOE performance. This book differs from other publications in that it extrapolates the findings from our study to a broader context on how the defined internal mechanisms implicate the local economy and global supply chains/markets. This book investigates robust theoretical foundations, and rigorous applied empirical research underpin the role of the State in SOEs. It differs from other studies in terms of qualitative and empirical research to providethe contextual setting to elucidate how to successfully navigate emerging market business with the State as an ""owner-participant."" This book explains the theoretical constructs of corporate governance in SOEs, applies empirical research methodologies, and draws results to validate inferences to (1) investigate the link between the board of directors and ownership attributes and agency cost levels using Vietnamese listed firms for the period from 2006 to 2013, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of State's corporate initiatives and monitoring through its sovereign wealth fund known as the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC), and (3) infer and explain the motivation of the State as a shareholder. This book takes cognizance of Vietnam's idiosyncratic institutional (using its sovereign wealth fund as an investment vehicle and management proxy), economic, regulatory, and corporate environments and the realities for developing an effective and sustainable business model, vis-à-vis the ownership structure, board of directors' composition and corporate governance, for better business performance. While the focus is on Vietnam, the content is also relevant to the role of the State in other emerging markets as a player in shaping the business strategy, model, and direction of SOEs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Investments; Market Research; Privatization; Supply Chains; Boards Of Directors; Corporate Governance; Emerging Markets; Empirical Research; Empirical Studies; Global Supply Chain; Local Economy; Performance; Sovereign Wealth Funds; Viet Nam; Commerce","Investments; Market Research; Privatization; Supply chains; Boards of directors; Corporate governance; Emerging markets; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Global supply chain; Local economy; Performance; Sovereign wealth funds; Viet Nam; Commerce","","","","Ruhuna Journal of Management and Finance, (2014); Ang, James S., Government ownership and the performance of government-linked companies: The case of Singapore, Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 16, 1, pp. 64-88, (2006); Business Behavior Value and Growth, (1959); Academy of Management Review, (1990); Modern Corporation and Private Property, (1932); Boubakri, Narjess, From state to private ownership: Issues from strategic industries, Journal of Banking and Finance, 33, 2, pp. 367-379, (2009); Singapore Journal of Legal Studies, (1995); Cheng, Louis T.W., Management demography and corporate performance: Evidence from China, International Business Review, 19, 3, pp. 261-275, (2010); Chen, Gongmeng, Does the type of ownership control matter?

This paper investigates whether Islamic and/or conventional stock market would be efficient through the non-stationarity test of the stock indices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct the linearity test of Harvey et al. (2008) to identify whether the considered series has linear or nonlinear behavior. If the time series exhibits nonlinear evolution, then the authors apply nonlinear unit root tests (three KSS type tests and Sollis tests). Findings: Linearity test results say that LCCSI has nonlinear behavior, while Dow Jones Islamic Canadian Price Index, LDJICPI, is a linear process. Then, the findings of this paper show that only Canadian Islamic Price Index (DJICPI) has the characteristics of random walk indicating that only conventional stock markets are inefficient. The major implication is that in Canada, fund managers and investors can (cannot) enjoy excess returns to their investment in conventional (Islamic) stock market. Originality/value: Numerous empirical studies of the weak EMH are carried out within a linear framework. However, stock indices can show nonlinear behavior as a result of 2008 global financial crisis. To contribute to the existing literature on the Islamic and conventional stock market efficiency, the authors take into account both structural breaks and nonlinearity. Thus, as a testing strategy for weak EMH, the authors perform (Harvey et al., 2008) linearity test to examine the presence of nonlinear behavior and correct for outliers effect when it is needed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Canadian Stock Markets; Djicpi And Ccsi; Linearity Test Of Harvey Et Al.

Countries with energy matrices that depend on water sources influenced by climatic phenomena must identify and control their impact on energy prices and financial markets. This research analyses if the El Niño Southern Oscillation phenomenon affects the relationship between electricity prices and financial markets. To that end, we apply wavelet analysis for bivariate time series and contagion tests to examine the correlations and evaluate the presence of contagion. The cross-wavelet power spectrum coherence coefficients suggest two periods where energy prices and the stock market are closely related: The strong El Niño phase in 2015, which confirms our conjecture, and the first stages of the 2020 Covid Pandemic. For the el Niño phase, the energy price leads the stock market in scales from three to eight months, while for the pandemic period, the unexpected disruption produces changing patterns for the same scales. There is also a robust long-term coherence for longer scales beginning in 2012. Moreover, the contagion tests confirm the contagion between markets during extreme climate events. Thus, our alternative method to uncover market relationships beyond traditional econometric contagion approaches contributes to theoretical discussions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contagion; El Niño; Energy Prices; Hydrological Risk; Wavelets; Atmospheric Pressure; Climate Change; Commerce; Costs; Time Series Analysis; Climate Impacts; Colombians; Contagion; El Nino; Energy; Energy Matrix; Energy Prices; Hydrological Risks; Water Source; Wavelet; Financial Markets; Climate Effect; El Nino; El Nino-southern Oscillation; Electricity; Energy Market; Financial Market; Price Determination; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Stock Market; Wavelet Analysis","Atmospheric pressure; Climate change; Commerce; Costs; Time series analysis; Climate impacts; Colombians; Contagion; EL Nino; Energy; Energy matrix; Energy prices; Hydrological risks; Water source; Wavelet; Financial markets; climate effect; El Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; electricity; energy market; financial market; price determination; spatiotemporal analysis; stock market; wavelet analysis","","","This work was supported by the Formación de Alto Nivel -FAN program of the Government of Valle del Cauca [Agreement 052 of November 30, 2016] approved by the Organo Colegiado de Administración- OCAD and decision of the Fondo de Ciencia y Tecnología -FCT and innovation of the Sistema General de Regalías-SGR.

The primary purpose of this paper is to determine the amount of investment in each of the shares of the listed company and the time of purchase, holding or sale of shares to maximize total return and reduce investment risk. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the goals of the problem, a two-level combined intelligent method, such as a support vector machine, decision tree, network Bayesian, k-nearest neighbors and multilayer perceptron neural network as heterogeneous basic models of ensemble learning in the first level, was applied. Then, the majority vote method (weighted average) in the second stage as the final model of learning was collectively used. Therefore, the data collected from 208 listed companies active in the Tehran stock exchange (http://tsetmc.com) from 2011 to 2015 have been used to teach the data. For testing and analysis, the data of the same companies between 2016 and 2020 have been used. Findings: The results showed that the method of combined ensemble learning and genetics has the highest total stock portfolio yield of 114.12%, with a risk of 0.905%. Also, by examining the rate of return on capital, it was observed that the proposed method has the highest average rate of return on investment of 110.64%. As a result, the proposed method leads to higher returns with lower risk than the purchase and maintenance method for fund managers and companies and predicts market trends. Research limitations/implications: In the forthcoming research, there were no limitations to obtain research data were easily extracted from the site of Tehran Stock Exchange Technology Management Company and Rahvard Novin software, and simulation was performed in MATLAB software. Practical implications: In this paper, using combined machine learning methods, companies’ stock prices are predicted and stock portfolio optimization is optimized. As companies and private organizations are trying to increase their rate of return, so they need a way to predict stock prices based on specific indicators. It turned out that this algorithm has the highest stock portfolio return with reasonable investment risk, and therefore, investors, portfolio managers and market timers can be used this method to optimize the stock portfolio. Social implications: The homogeneous and heterogeneous two-level hybrid model presented in the research can be used to predict market trends by market timers and fund managers. Also, adjusting the portfolio with this method has a much higher return than the return on buying and holding, and with controlled risk, it increases the security of investors’ capital, and investors invest their capital in the funds more safely. And will achieve their expected returns. As a result, the psychological security gained from using this method for portfolio arrangement will eventually lead to the growth of the capital market. Originality/value: This paper tries to present the best combination of stock portfolios of active companies of the Tehran Stock Exchange by using the two-level combined intelligent method and genetic algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined Learning Methods; Ensemble Learning; Market Timing; Portfolio Balancing","","","","","Portfolio Preservation During Severe Market Corrections A Market Timing Enhancement to Modern Portfolio Theory, (2014); Andersson, Tommy Daniel G., Balancing value and risk within a city's event portfolio: an explorative study of DMO professionals' assessments, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 11, 4, pp. 413-432, (2020); Appelbe, Trent W., Econometric modelling of Canadian long distance calling: A comparison of aggregate time series versus point-to-point panel data approaches, Empirical Economics, 17, 1, pp. 125-140, (1992); Ballings, Michel, Evaluating multiple classifiers for stock price direction prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 20, pp. 7046-7056, (2015); Bigerna, Simona, Balancing energy security priorities: portfolio optimization approach to oil imports, Applied Economics, 53, 5, pp. 555-574, (2021); Boado-Penas, M.

Design/methodology/approach: The stochastic frontier approach was used to estimate the financial and social efficiency scores, in a first step. In a second step, the impact of risk-taking on efficiency was evaluated. The authors also took into account the moderating role of capital structure in this effect using the fixed and random effects generalized least squares (GLS) with a first-order autoregressive disturbance. The used dataset covers 326 conventional MFIs and 57 Islamic MFIs in six different regions of the world over the period of 2005–2015. Findings: The overall average efficiency scores are less than 50%, where CMFIs could have produced their outputs using 48% of their actual inputs. IMFIs record the lowest financial (cost) efficiency that is equal to 28% on average. The estimation results also reveal a negative impact of nonperforming loan on financial and social efficiency. Finally, the moderating effect of leverage funding on the relationship between credit risk-taking and financial efficiency was confirmed in CMFIs. However, leverage seems to moderate the effect of risk-taking behavior on social efficiency for IMFIs. Originality/value: This paper makes an initial attempt to evaluate the effect of risk-taking decision and its implication on efficiency and MFIs' sustainability. Besides, it takes into consideration the role played by the mode of governance through the ownership structure. In addition, this research study sheds light on the importance of the financial support for the development and sustainability of these institutions, which in return, contributes to a sustainable economic development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Structure; Conventional And Islamic Microfinance Institutions; Credit Risk-taking; Financial And Social Efficiency; Stochastic Frontier Approach","","","","","Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2014); Abdul Rahman, Rashidah Binti, Challenges and solutions in Islamic microfinance, Humanomics, 29, 4, pp. 293-306, (2013); South Asian Journal of Management Sciences, (2016); Relationship Between Budgetary Controls and Financial Performance of State Cooperation in Kenya, (2012); Ahmad, Syedah, The double bottom line of microfinance: A global comparison between conventional and Islamic microfinance, World Development, 136, (2020); Islamic Economic Studies, (2002); Aigner, Dennis J., Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models, Journal of Econometrics, 6, 1, pp. 21-37, (1977); Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences, (2016); Altunbaş, Yener, Examining the relationships between capital, risk and efficiency in European banking, European Financial Management, 13, 1, pp. 49-70, (2007); Finance Bien Commun, (2008)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17468817; 17468809","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107780056"

The authors consider a comprehensive set of information variables under five categories: macroeconomics, blockchain technology, other assets, stress level, and investor sentiment. Their approach toward this large dataset is built upon dimension-reduction models such as Backward Elimination, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), principal component regression (PCR), and three-pass regression filter (3PRF). The empirical results show that blockchain technology, stress level, and investor sentiment have positive, negative, and positive predicting power on Bitcoin returns, respectively. Macroeconomic variables exhibit insignificant impacts on Bitcoin returns. Other asset variables show little predicting power until 2019, but some become a significant predictor during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the authors caution against using Bitcoin as a risk-hedging device in financial portfolios. They also find that, consistent with other financial assets such as equities, Bitcoin shows increased predictability with a longer return horizon. Due to their empirical results, they also advocate the use of 3PRF; relative to other dimension-reduction methods under consideration, they observe superior performance of 3PRF in predicting both the level and the direction of future Bitcoin returns across all return horizons. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Alfieri, Élise, On the nature and financial performance of bitcoin, Journal of Risk Finance, 20, 2, pp. 114-137, (2019); Baig, Ahmed S., Price clustering and sentiment in bitcoin, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 111-116, (2019); Baur, Dirk G., Bitcoin: Medium of exchange or speculative assets?, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 54, pp. 177-189, (2018); Bianchi, Daniele, Cryptocurrencies as an asset class?

Additionally, this study examines the interaction between economic freedom dimensions and oil prices. To meet the study's objectives, a two-step GMM estimator was applied to the data collected from 173 banks in 18 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region countries during 2010–2020. The findings revealed that the influence of economic, business, and labour freedoms on banks’ stock returns was negative and significant, but government spending was positive and significant. The results for the region's monarchies indicated similar effects to those of the entire MENA region, except for lagged bank stock returns that were negative. Besides, both investor sentiment and uncertainty positively impact bank stock returns. In addition, it was found that the interaction between freedom and oil price significantly and positively impacted bank performance. The robustness testing results confirmed this finding.

Despite this, literature on the subject to-date does not offer consensus on how CEO overconfidence biases interact with corporate governance in determining company strategies for financing its capital investments. Our paper aims to address a specific gap in the literature concerning the potentially moderating role of board diversification on the CEO overconfidence and its impact on corporate capital structure decision-making. In a major innovation to the literature, we look at board diversity from five perspectives: gender and age diversity, board independence, board size, and the duality of the roles of CEO and chairperson. To make our findings methodologically robust, we consider two measures of the CEOs’ overconfidence: media-based measure (implied measure of overconfidence) and CEO stock purchases (revealed measure of overconfidence). We extend our analysis to the top 100 US listed companies over 2011–2019 — the period between two systemic crises, the Great Recession and the Covid19 pandemic. We show that general effect of board diversity on CEO overconfidence is highly sensitive to different measures of overconfidence. CEOs’ implied overconfidence has a negative correlation with debt financing of the company, which is consistent with the findings of Heaton (2002). These results do not hold for the revealed measure of CEO overconfidence. Board diversity plays an important role in moderating the impact of CEO overconfidence on capital structure decisions. This holds for gender diversity, and for the board size and the number of independent directors, confirming prior literature on the subject. However, age diversity of the board and the duality of the CEO and chairperson are insignificant in moderating CEO overconfidence, which adds new insights to the literature to-date. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Diversity; Ceo Overconfidence; Financing Decisions; Fortune 100","","","","","Adams, Renée B., Powerful CEOs and their impact on corporate performance, Review of Financial Studies, 18, 4, pp. 1403-1432, (2005); Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Adams, Renée B., Women on boards in finance and STEM industries, American Economic Review, 106, 5, pp. 277-281, (2016); Adams, Renée B., Bank board structure and performance: Evidence for large bank holding companies, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 21, 2, pp. 243-267, (2012); Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2014); Alfraih, Mishari M., The effectiveness of board of directors’ characteristics in mandatory disclosure compliance, Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance, 24, 2, pp. 154-176, (2016); Ali, Muhammad, Board Age and Gender Diversity: A Test of Competing Linear and Curvilinear Predictions, Journal of Business Ethics, 125, 3, pp. 497-512, (2014); Anderson, Ronald C., Board characteristics, accounting report integrity, and the cost of debt, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 37, 3, pp. 315-342, (2004); Andreou, Panayiotis C., Corporate Governance and Firm-specific Stock Price Crashes, European Financial Management, 22, 5, pp. 916-956, (2016); Arora, Akshita, Gender diversity in boardroom and its impact on firm performance, Journal of Management and Governance, 26, 3, pp. 735-755, (2022)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22146350; 22146369","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146060969"

Further the study aims to develop a parsimonious bond rating model and compare its efficacy across statistical and range of machine learning methods in the Indian context. The study is motivated by the insufficiency of prior work in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify the critical determinants of non-financial and financial firms using multinomial logistic regression. Various machine learning and statistical methods are employed to identify the optimal bond rating prediction model. The data cover 8,346 bond issues from 2009 to 2019. Findings: The authors find that industry concentration, sales, operating leverage, operating efficiency, profitability, solvency, strategic ownership, age, firm size and firm value play an important role in rating non-financial firms. Operating efficiency, profitability, strategic ownership and size are also relevant for financial firms besides additional determinants related to the capital adequacy, asset quality, management efficiency, earnings quality and liquidity (CAMEL) approach. The authors find that random forest outperforms logit and other machine learning methods with an accuracy rate of 92 and 91% for non-financial and financial firms. Practical implications: The study identifies important determinants of bond ratings for both non-financial and financial firms. The study interalia finds that the random forest technique is the most appropriate method for bond ratings predictions in India. Social implications: Better bond ratings may mitigate corporate defaults. Originality/value: Unlike prior literature, the study identifies determinants of bond ratings for both non-financial and financial firms. The study also experiments with modern machine learning techniques besides the traditional statistical approach for model building in case of relatively under researched market. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bond Rating; Camel Approach; Financial Firms; Machine Learning Methods; Multinomial Logistic Regression; Non-financial Firms","","","","This work was supported by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India.","Abdou, Hussein A., CREDIT SCORING, STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES AND EVALUATION CRITERIA: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 18, 2-3, pp. 59-88, (2011); Abdou, Hussein A., Predicting creditworthiness in retail banking with limited scoring data, Knowledge-Based Systems, 103, pp. 89-103, (2016); Adams, Mike B., The determinants of credit ratings in the United Kingdom insurance industry, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 30, 3-4, pp. 539-572, (2003); Addo, Peter Martey, Credit risk analysis using machine and deep learning models, Risks, 6, 2, (2018); Ahmad, Wasim, Eurozone crisis and BRIICKS stock markets: Contagion or market interdependence?, Economic Modelling, 33, pp. 209-225, (2013); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., ZETATM analysis A new model to identify bankruptcy risk of corporations, Journal of Banking and Finance, 1, 1, pp. 29-54, (1977); Angelini, Eliana, A neural network approach for credit risk evaluation, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 48, 4, pp. 733-755, (2008); Operating Leverage Credit Ratings and the Cost of Debt, (2017); Baesens, Bart M.M., Using neural network rule extraction and decision tables for credit-risk evaluation, Management Science, 49, 3, pp. 312-329, (2003)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","03074358; 17587743","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139066645"

The authors’ specific interest is on any changes that may be observed in US stock markets during the COVID-19 outbreak. This information will help us assess the extent to which policymakers adopted at time revenue and expenditures measures to minimize its negative impact. Design/methodology/approach: The authors study the linkage between layoffs announced by firms and stock markets in US for the COVID-19 period between March 2020 and October 2020. This period shows important economic figures; a huge number of job cuts announced by blue-chip companies listed in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) due to widespread economic shutdowns. The authors examine whether and to what extent stock markets in US have reacted to layoff announcements during the COVID-19 pandemic using an event-study methodology. Findings: The study’s results show that US layoffs during the pandemic did not cause any abnormalities on the stock returns, either positive or negative. Based on the mean-adjusted volume, the authors find that layoffs increase the stocks' trading volume, especially on the event date and the day following the event. US stocks become more volatile on the days following the event. Interestingly, on the event date, the authors find that stocks get the highest abnormal volatility; however, the result is statistically insignificant. Practical implications: The authors suggest that layoffs announcements follow the business cycle quite closely in most industries. The study’s results have implications for investors, regulators and policymakers as they permit to examine the effectiveness of the measures adopted. Social implications: The study’s results show that policymakers reduced uncertainty implementing intensive measures quickly and should follow similar policy in the future pandemic and/or unexpected events. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature in two directions: First, to the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first study that provides empirical evidence and assesses the extent to which a major global shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic may have altered the reaction of US stock markets to layoff announcements. Second, this is the first study on this topic that examines volume and volatility abnormalities, while the authors check the robustness of the findings with different methods to calculate abnormal returns. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abnormal Returns; Covid-19; Event-study Methodology; Layoffs; Stock Market Reaction; Us","","","","","Ajinkya, Bipin B., The behavior of daily stock market trading volume, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 11, 4, pp. 331-359, (1989); Al-Qudah, Anas Ali, Stock markets' reaction to COVID-19: evidence from the six WHO regions, Journal of Economic Studies, 49, 2, pp. 274-289, (2022); Albulescu, Claudiu Tiberiu, COVID-19 and the United States financial markets’ volatility, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Alizadeh, Sassan, Range-based estimation of stochastic volatility models, Journal of Finance, 57, 3, pp. 1047-1091, (2002); Altig, David E., Economic uncertainty before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, Journal of Public Economics, 191, (2020); Anh, Dao Le Trang, The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on stock market performance: evidence from Vietnam, Journal of Economic Studies, 48, 4, pp. 836-851, (2020); Baig, Ahmed S., Deaths, panic, lockdowns and US equity markets: The case of COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Baker, Scott R., The unprecedented stock market reaction to COVID-19, Review of Asset Pricing Studies, 10, 4, pp. 742-758, (2020); Journal of Accounting Research, (1968); Brookings Papers on Economic Activity Microeconomics, (1990)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","01443585","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121831895"

Design/methodology/approach: In order to test the relationship between Altman Z-score model as a credit risk proxy and the Return on Asset and Equity as indicator for financial performance with control variables leverage, liquidity and firm size. Least Square Dummy Variable regression analysis is opted. This research's sample included 69 non-financial companies from the Pakistan Stock Exchange KSE-100 Index between 2012 and 2017. Findings: This study establishes the findings that Altman Z-score, leverage and firm size significantly impact the financial performance of the KSE-100 non-financial firms. However, liquidity is found to be insignificant in this study. Altman Z-score and firm size have shown a positive relationship to the financial performance, whereas leverage is inversely related. Practical implications: This study brings in a new and useful insight into the literature on the relationship between credit risk and financial performance. The results of this study provide investors, businesses and managers related to non-financial firms in the KSE-100 index with significant insight about credit risk's impact on performance. Originality/value: The evidence of the credit risk and financial performance on samples of non-financial firms has not been studied; mainly it has been limited to the banking sector.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Chinese-listed companies from 2010 to 2020, the study adopts fixed effects models to empirically analyze the effect of independent director-CEO friendliness on the enterprise's sustainable growth capability and the roles of CSR and executive compensation. Findings: This study finds that independent director-CEO friendliness is significantly positively correlated with the sustainable growth capability of an enterprise, and this effect is enhanced with the improvement of the degree of CSR fulfillment. What is more, the positive relationship between independent director-CEO friendliness and the enterprise's sustainable growth capability becomes stronger with higher executive compensation. Originality/value: Given that the existing research on sustainable growth capability mainly focused on the macroeconomic field, this study is of great theoretical significance in exploring the relationship between independent director-CEO friendliness and the enterprise's sustainable growth capability from the micro-level, contributing to the research on the enterprise's sustainable growth capability.

Particularly, it is to gain empirical evidence whether firms with more female corporate leaders are more (less) likely to engage in corporate fraud. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data of fraud firms from Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases. As a focus of the study, the authors take the fraud sample observations from the last 10 years, from 2011 to 2021. The idea is that the number of firms sectioned due to corporate fraud reached a peak in such periods. Findings: In the context of non-state-owned enterprise environments, the authors find female corporate leaders are less likely to engage in corporate fraud. However, among firms with a state-owned background, the authors’ empirical evidence shows that the roles of female corporate leaders remain under-represented in the boardrooms. As reported, the presence of female corporate leaders does not bring a significant impact on enhancing group ethical decision-making and governance quality. This situation does appear when political connections between firms and governments or politicians are prevalent. Research limitations/implications: This study has practical and theoretical implications. Given the increased pressure on companies around the globe to have more females in their boardrooms, this study provides insight into the effect of female corporate leaders on the prevalence of corporate fraud. As such, this study offers critical consideration for policymakers and regulators. Moreover, an analysis of whether and when the gender board diversity is associated with the firm’ propensity to perpetrate corporate fraud, particularly from the US corporate fraud, is sorely lacking. This study contributes to such gaps.

The major empirical findings as shown as followings. There are heterogeneous responses from SR to AQ within the same city. Different links are discovered for Beijing and Shanghai within the same industry. Air pollution does not have political or economic properties for all industries. Our research provides useful contributions compared with past literature. First of all, we distinguish whether air pollution is political or economic. Apart from psychology and physiology, government intervention and economic expectation are also important components in interpreting the influence from AQ to SR. Second, this study adequately considers the heterogeneity of industries. Industries differently react to the identical extrinsic shock, depending on the nature of their industry. Besides, the QQ approach captures quantile-varying relationship between variables, and does not need to consider structural fracture and time lag effects. The practical significance is that investors need to focus on national industrial policies, and avoiding biased decisions in stock market from air pollution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Quality; Industry Heterogeneity; Quantile-on-quantile Approach; Stock Return; Air Quality; Atmospheric Pollution; Government; Heterogeneity; Industrial Technology; Psychology; Stock Market; Beijing [china]; China; Shanghai; Air Pollution; Industry; Politics; Air Pollution; Beijing; Industry; Politics","air quality; atmospheric pollution; government; heterogeneity; industrial technology; psychology; stock market; Beijing [China]; China; Shanghai; air pollution; industry; politics; Air Pollution; Beijing; Industry; Politics","","","","An, Na, Study on the influence mechanism of air quality on stock market yield and Volatility: Empirical test from China based on GARCH model, Finance Research Letters, 26, pp. 119-125, (2018); Andrikopoulos, Athanasios, Is there still a weather anomaly?

Firstly, the ISBM-based EMD method is used to decompose the time series of Brent crude oil prices into several IMFs (intrinsic mode functions) and residuals r<inf>n</inf>(t). Then IMFs and residuals r<inf>n</inf>(t) are inputted into the FNN model as input layer neurons, which are trained and integrated by the FNN model to study the relationship between the output values of the FNN and actual values. In order to verify the forecasting results of the EMD-ISBM-FNN model, two research frameworks and three strategies are designed, and the EMD-FNN model and the FNN model as the benchmark models are constructed to compare their forecasting results. The research shows that the EMD-ISBM-FNN model proposed in this paper has the best forecasting effect under the three strategies, and the research framework of this paper is better than the previous scholars' research frameworks, too. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crude Oil Prices Forecasting; Emd-isbm-fnn; Forecasting Strategy; Costs; Crude Oil; Feedforward Neural Networks; Forecasting; Neural Network Models; Crude Oil Price Forecasting; Crude Oil Prices; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Empirical Mode Decomposition-improved Slope-based Method-forward Neural Network; Forecasting Strategy; Intrinsic Mode Functions; Neural Network Method; Neural Network Model; Neural-networks; Research Frameworks; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Crude Oil; Decomposition Analysis; Forecasting Method; Numerical Model; Price Dynamics","Costs; Crude oil; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Neural network models; Crude oil price forecasting; Crude oil prices; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Empirical mode decomposition-improved slope-based method-forward neural network; Forecasting strategy; Intrinsic Mode functions; Neural network method; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Research frameworks; Empirical mode decomposition; crude oil; decomposition analysis; forecasting method; numerical model; price dynamics","","","This research was supported by National Science Found of China (Grant No. 71171083; Grant No.71771087; Grant No.72171086).","Wang, Yudong, Energy prices and exchange rates of the U.S. dollar: Further evidence from linear and nonlinear causality analysis, Economic Modelling, 29, 6, pp. 2289-2297, (2012); Chou, Li Chen, The effect of democracy on energy efficiency in European countries, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja, 33, 1, pp. 3476-3491, (2020); Wang, Qiusu, Can fiscal decentralisation regulate the impact of industrial structure on energy efficiency?, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja, 34, 1, pp. 1727-1751, (2021); Jammazi, Rania, Crude oil price forecasting: Experimental evidence from wavelet decomposition and neural network modeling, Energy Economics, 34, 3, pp. 828-841, (2012); Lin, Qi, Technical analysis and stock return predictability: An aligned approach, Journal of Financial Markets, 38, pp. 103-123, (2018); Mahmood, Faisal, Corporate social responsibility and firms’ financial performance: a multi-level serial analysis underpinning social identity theory, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja, 34, 1, pp. 2447-2468, (2021); Wang, Qingfeng, Crude oil price: Demand, supply, economic activity, economic policy uncertainty and wars – From the perspective of structural equation modelling (SEM), Energy, 133, pp. 483-490, (2017); Hamilton, James D., Understanding crude oil prices, Energy Journal, 30, 2, pp. 179-206, (2009); Kilian, Lutz, Quantifying the speculative component in the real price of oil: The role of global oil inventories, Journal of International Money and Finance, 42, pp. 71-87, (2014); Coletti, Donald, Commodities and monetary policy: Implications for inflation and price level targeting, Journal of Policy Modeling, 43, 5, pp. 982-999, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03605442; 18736785","0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808","ENEYD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139735800"

It is motivated by the phenomenon that CSR is developing in two different directions (global vs local). Design/methodology/approach: A comparative study on sustainability-linked compensation illustrates how CSR in the USA is driven by firm-level economic decisions, in which the manifestations of CSR are usually those which prove to be the most profitable financially. Moreover, a case analysis on the green bond market in China contrarily illustrates how CSR in China is usually based more on alignment with top-down, state-led initiatives in which the state directs the ways in which CSR is manifested. Findings: This paper reveals that despite globalizing trends are attempting to unify definitions of CSR, they inevitably become localized to fit the societal needs in which they are located. Originality/value: By understanding how CSR development in these two countries has changed over time, this paper shows that future developments in CSR will likely be influenced more by local practices than by converging global forces. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Comparative Analysis; Corporate Social Responsibility; Executive Compensation; Green Bonds; United States","","","","The authors appreciate the constructive comments from the editors, reviewers, Dan Guttman, Ulf Richter, Oran Young and seminar participants at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and University of Nottingham Ningbo China.

This book summarizes the causes and effects of political corruption as well as anti-corruption mechanisms and initiatives; analyzes how political corruption at both state and local levels determines corporate financial decisions (investment, financing, and dividend); and discusses how the corruption environment determines firm-level financial behavior. The first three chapters of the book introduce political corruption, the status of political corruption, and anti-corruption campaigns around the world. The last three chapters focus on how firms make financial decisions, and the role of political corruption in corporate finance.

By strategically investing in both intellectual and physical capital, companies can enhance their financial performance through optimal resource utilization. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of intellectual capital, capital structure, and corporate governance on mitigating financial distress and financial ratios as an early warning system. The sample consisted of financial sector companies in Indonesia from 2012 to 2022, and a binary regression model was used to estimate potential predictor variables. It was found that IC by proxy, human resources, customer, and organizational capital tends to improve the company performance, mitigating financial distress.

EVA supports strategic planning, and management can measure and evaluate performance at the division level. Through it, you can find results that are important not only for the company's management and the owners but also for the company's shareholders. For businesses in the market, it is essential to measure and evaluate the performance of the business, as they are exposed to the risk of competition and, of course, pressure from the environment. However, many companies are underestimating this measurement due to time-consuming and evaluating business performance based on financial statements. Therefore, they can only assess traditional indicators, often insufficient to determine the company's performance. The paper aims to inform readers about all necessary information related to the EVA method and draw the calculation on a specific example. We have determined the application of the method to a particular company as our primary goal. Therefore, we can get information on the performance of the selected company. The applied values and data are further applied and interpreted, which results in how the company manages its assets and how it can continue to improve its performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Company Performance; Economic Value Added; Eva; Financial Analysis; Weighted Average Cost Of Capital","","","","This research received no external funding.","Dancaková, Darya, The Impact of Intangible Assets on the Market Value of Companies: Cross-Sector Evidence, Mathematics, 10, 20, (2022); Vykonnost Podniku Z Pohledu Financniho Manazera, (2005); Moderni Metody Hodnoceni Vykonnosti A Ocenovani Podniku, (2005); Ad Alta Journal of Interdisciplinary Research, (2022); Metody Komplexniho Hodnoceni Podniku, (2011); Jankalova, Miriam, Sustainability assessment using economic value added, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 1, (2020); In Proceedings of the Thriving on Future Education, (2019); Šoltés, Vincent, Modification of performance measurement system in the intentions of globalization trends, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 11, 2, pp. 160-170, (2015); Eva and Cash Value Added do Not Measure Shareholder Value Creation, (2019); Foundations of Economic Method, (1982)","","HACCP Consulting","","","","","","13370960; 13380230","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186105144"

Every organisation seeks to maintain itself and, more crucially, to develop quickly through inorganic means. The expansion of a company through mergers and acquisitions is an inorganic process. Organic growth takes a very long period and is time-bound, but inorganic growth through mergers may be achieved quickly. This research aimed to determine whether the operating results of Indian beverage firms have improved after the merger or not. Methods: In order to assess merger-related advantages to the acquiring firms, this study used the operating performance technique, which contrasts the pre-merger and post-merger performance of corporations using accounting data. Secondary data were used to carry out this study. The operating performance was assessed on six operating parameters (ratios) i.e. Operating Profit Margin, Gross and Net Profit Margin, Debt-Equity, Return on Net Worth and Capital Employed. The comparison was done for three years pre and post-merger period of these operating ratios. Results: The findings demonstrate that mergers do not seek to increase owner wealth. This finding shows that rather than just becoming larger and achieving covert goals, managers should pay more attention to post-merger integration challenges in order to produce merger-induced synergies. Conclusion: This study shows that the M&As have not had a good effect on a company’s operating performance, especially for the chosen beverage companies in India. Since financial measures cannot fully account for the influence of mergers on business performance, future research may create other metrics for merger-related gains. Research that provides profound insights into the causes and trends of post-merger business performance through the different types of mergers and industries would also be beneficial. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Acquisition; Beverage Industry; Financial Performance; Merger; Operating Performance; Article; Benchmarking; Beverage; Commercial Phenomena; Controlled Study; Human; Mergers And Acquisitions; Health Care Facility; India; Industry; Commerce; Health Facility Merger; Industry","article; benchmarking; beverage; commercial phenomena; controlled study; human; mergers and acquisitions; health care facility; India; industry; Commerce; Health Facility Merger; Industry","","","","Aggarwal, Puja, Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on Accounting-based Performance of Acquiring Firms in India, Global Business Review, 23, 1, pp. 218-236, (2022); An Analysis of Mergers in the Private Corporate Sector in India, (2000); Behr, Andreas, The success of bank mergers revisited.

Design/Methodology/Approach: A panel data of 110 Pakistani firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for the period of 12 years (2008-2019) was analysed using the GMM approach. Research findings: The GMM regression results revealed significant relationships. The analysis suggests that CEOs with considerable structural, ownership, prestige, and expert power tend to exhibit superior performance, as these factors are positively correlated with firm performance. Conversely, CEO family power appears to have no discernible impact on firm performance. Importantly, the robustness of our findings underscores the consistent nature of these relationships. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study makes a valuable contribution to the existing literature by demonstrating the positive influence of CEO power on firm performance, which aligns with the theoretical framework of the Approach/Inhibition theory of power. The originality of this research stems from its examination of individual dimensions of CEO power and their impact on firm performance, as well as the inclusion of the additional dimension of family power. Practitioner/Policy implication: The insight from this study suggests that powerful CEO leadership is beneficial for firm performance and the concentration of power at the CEO position should be seen positively rather than the negative perspective provided by agency theory.

The results show that companies with stable suppliers conducted more downward real earnings management prior to a private placement than those without such suppliers to form collaborative relationships with suppliers for earnings management. The suppliers mainly assisted majority shareholders in tunnelling, conducting covert methods such as share price discounts and offering cash dividends. This could be driven by the prospect of obtaining more purchases from the company following the private placement.

Given that China is extensively investing in green projects to achieve carbon neutrality, this strand of research offers important implications for investors and policymakers. Methodologically, we employ the GARCH-MIDAS model to examine the effect of the climate policy uncertainty (CPU) index on the volatility levels of the Chinese clean energy exchange-traded fund (ETF). We compare the effects of the CPU index with leading uncertainty indicators, including the crude oil volatility index, geopolitical risk, and technology sector volatility. The in-sample and out-of-sample analyses show that CPU has significant predictive contents for forecasting the volatility of renewable energy ETF and that the GARCH-MIDAS-CPU process outperforms other approaches.

Our findings confirm the positive impact of sentiment on earnings management through accruals. Our results confirm that in the presence of a stringent regulatory environment, the likelihood of abnormal accruals following a positive sentiment environment is low. We document that a stringent regulatory environment reduces the likelihood of abnormal accruals following a positive sentiment environment.

However, many of these businesses fail in their early stages, making it important to investigate factors that influence their short-term solvency. This study aims to examine the impact of capital structure and profitability on the short-term solvency of nascent SMEs in Ghana, building on the liability of newness framework. METHODOLOGY: Data for this study were obtained from the Ghana Enterprises Agency, focusing on nascent SMEs that are five years old or less. Financial statements were used to measure the dependent and independent variables, and regression analysis was employed to measure the variance in short-term solvency accounted for by profitability and capital structure. FINDINGS: This study demonstrates that financing decisions and financial performance act as crucial mitigating factors for the potential risks of default and failure faced by nascent SMEs. Notably, the study finds that an appropriate balance between debt and equity financing raises the working capital ratio and thus reduces the liability of newness, which is a major challenge faced by nascent SMEs. This highlights the relevance of the trade-off theory, which recommends a combination of debt and equity financing to leverage the advantages of both sources of capital, in the context of nascent SMEs. The intricate relationship between profitability and short-term solvency in nascent SMEs was revealed in this study. The findings illustrate that while return on equity exhibits a direct impact on the short-term solvency of such SMEs, return on assets manifests an opposing effect. Furthermore, net profit after tax demonstrates only a nominal influence on the short-term solvency of nascent SMEs in Ghana. IMPLICATIONS: The implications of our study are far-reaching, particularly within the context of Ghana’s nascent SMEs. To ensure short-term viability and facilitate a smooth transition to maturity, nascent SMEs must strive for an optimal debt-to-equity ratio. This critical insight underscores the importance of managing the capital structure of nascent SMEs, as the improper balance between debt and equity may impede the achievement of short-term solvency and, in turn, hinder the long-term success of the firm. Additionally, while nascent SMEs must prioritize maintaining liquidity to safeguard against unforeseen contingencies, this comes at a high cost in terms of missed opportunities that could significantly enhance the company’s long-term return on assets. Thus, it is crucial for small business owners in Ghana to strike a balance between short-term solvency and return on assets by engaging in prudent financial management practices. Overall, our study provides valuable theoretical and practical implications for nascent SMEs in Ghana, emphasizing the need to optimize their capital structure and maximize their long-term return on assets while safeguarding their short-term liquidity. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The study’s conceptualization that capital structure and profitability relate significantly to short-term solvency and, therefore, buffers the liability of newness is novel. Second, by showing that the trade-off theory’s tenets are relevant to the short-term solvency of nascent SMEs, the study demonstrates that capital structure theories apply equally to SMEs, just as much as large firms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Structure; Economic Growth; Emerging Economies; Liability Of Newness; Liquidity; New Firm Survival; Profitability; Short-term Solvency; Smes","","","","","Abe, Masato, Financing small and medium enterprises in Asia and the Pacific, Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy, 4, 1, pp. 2-32, (2015); Abel, Andrew B., Optimal Debt and Profitability in the Trade-Off Theory, Journal of Finance, 73, 1, pp. 95-143, (2018); Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, The effect of capital structure on profitability: an empirical analysis of listed firms in Ghana, Journal of Risk Finance, 6, 5, pp. 438-445, (2005); Entrepreneurial Finance for Msmes A Managerial Approach for Developing Markets, (2017); Abor, Patience Aseweh, The effects of healthcare governance and ownership structure on the performance of hospitals in Ghana, International Journal of Law and Management, 57, 2, pp. 107-140, (2015); Agyei, James, Trade-Off Theory Versus Pecking Order Theory: Ghanaian Evidence, SAGE Open, 10, 3, (2020); Economics Management and Financial Markets, (2012); American Journal of Economics Finance and Management, (2015); Strategies for Sustainability of Small and Medium Enterprises in Ghana, (2019); Journal of Finance and Marketing, (2019)","","Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science","","","","","","22997326; 22997075","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176790074"

This study aims to investigate the impact of the board composition index on CSR disclosure in the context of the United States. In addition, the study examines whether board characteristics (board size, board diligence, board duality and board independence) impact CSR disclosure. Panel data for S&P 1500 index firms were collected from the data stream portal. The current study employed a sample of 286 US firms from 2010 to 2020. To achieve the research objectives, the current study develops an index score very first time for board composition. A panel regression model with fixed and random effects was employed to estimate the proposed hypotheses. In addition, the problem of endogeneity was resolved through the dynamic GMM model. The results of the study revealed that the board composition index has a significant impact on the disclosure of CSR information. Moreover, higher board diligence and independence in US corporates enhance CSR disclosure. However, board duality and the size of the board room negatively and significantly impact CSR. US policymakers and legislators make reforms in composition and structure to build stakeholders’ interest. In addition, no study combined such corporate board variables to address CSR in developed countries.

The finding indicates that the AARs on the announcement date are not significant at the 5% level. However, the CAARs on the announcement date were negative abnormal returns and statistically significant. This reveals that the stock market is not reacting efficiently to the announcement of corporate crime because the stock price was not fully reflected in all publicly available information. Furthermore, the results of the fixed effect model revealed that firm size and dividend per share have a significant effect on stock price, whereas price-to-book value and earnings per share have insignificant relationships with stock price in the context of firms involved in corporate crime. This study intends to provide a better understanding of the causes of corporate crime and prevent corporate crime from becoming widespread in the country, thereby reducing the number of corporations that participate in crime. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Announcement; Corporate Crime; Event Study; Fixed Effect; Malaysia; Stock Price","","","","This work is supported by Universiti Malaysia Sarawak and the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education.","Kpmg Fraud Survey 2004 Report, (2005); Are Our Laws Sufficient Deterrents, (2005); White Collar Crime in Malaysia, (2005); Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries 2000 2009, (2008); Seeing Red Over White Collar Crimes, (2014); White Collar Crime and Stock Return Empirical Study from Announcement Effect, (2011); Corruption Perception Index, (2013); Kpmg Malaysia Fraud Bribery and Corruption Survey 2013, (2013); Rachagan, Shanthy, Encouraging Whistle Blowing to Improve Corporate Governance?

Board culture will have an important impact on corporate innovation, So what kind of board culture can Chinese boards build to better contribute to corporate innovation? Based on this core issue, this paper empirically explores the relationship between board authority culture, board cultural diversity and corporate innovation from the unique perspective of board culture. The results show that board authority culture is negatively related to corporate innovation; board cultural diversity can negatively regulate the relationship between board authority culture and corporate innovation, that is, the construction of diverse board culture of the Chinese board is more conducive to corporate innovation. The main reason why board authority culture inhibits corporate innovation is that board authority culture has obedience effect and inhibits corporate innovation through the path of increasing agency costs and weakening management risk preferences. Further research finds that the negative moderating effect of board culture diversity on the relationship between board authority culture and corporate innovation is more effective when the chairman has the highest authority directorship and has reputation authority but not political resource authority and organisation authority. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Authority Culture; Board Cultural Diversity; Corporate Innovation; Obedience Effect","","","","Funding text 1: We appreciate constructive comments from Donghua Chen.

ML tools are increasingly adopted by hedge funds and asset managers, notably for alpha signal generation and stocks selection. The technicality of the subject can make it hard for non-specialists to join the bandwagon, as the jargon and coding requirements may seem out-of-reach. Machine learning for factor investing: Python version bridges this gap. It provides a comprehensive tour of modern ML-based investment strategies that rely on firm characteristics. The book covers a wide array of subjects which range from economic rationales to rigorous portfolio back-testing and encompass both data processing and model interpretability. Common supervised learning algorithms such as tree models and neural networks are explained in the context of style investing and the reader can also dig into more complex techniques like autoencoder asset returns, Bayesian additive trees and causal models. All topics are illustrated with self-contained Python code samples and snippets that are applied to a large public dataset that contains over 90 predictors. The material is available online so that readers can reproduce and enhance the examples at their convenience.

Meanwhile, little is known about the implications of BGD on risk in microfinance institutions (MFI). This study aims to fill this gap. Using a data sample retrieved from the MIX Market database spanning the 2009–2018 period and the random-effects estimator, we find that the proportion of female directors on the board is positively associated with financial stability of MFIs measured by the Z-score. The result is robust when using alternative measures of financial stability and BGD, and alternative estimation techniques. In addition, we document a negative relationship between BGD and risk-taking behavior of MFIs. Further, the research result favors the critical mass theory rather than tokenism. Lastly, we find that BGD links with financial stability in a monotonic instead of non-monotonic manner. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Female Directors; Financial Stability; Gender Diversity; Microfinance Institutions; Risk","","","","","Abou-El-Sood, Heba S., Board gender diversity, power, and bank risk taking, International Review of Financial Analysis, 75, (2021); Abrar, Afsheen, Finance-growth nexus and banking efficiency: The impact of microfinance institutions, Journal of Economics and Business, 114, (2021); Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Adams, Renée B., Beyond the glass ceiling: Does gender matter?, Management Science, 58, 2, pp. 219-235, (2012); Lehman Sisters, (2017); Adusei, Michael, Board and management gender diversity and financial performance of microfinance institutions, Cogent Business and Management, 4, 1, (2017); Adusei, Michael, Board gender diversity and the capital structure of microfinance institutions: A global analysis, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 71, pp. 258-269, (2019); Anginer, Deniz, How does competition affect bank systemic risk?, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 23, 1, pp. 1-26, (2014); Arellano, Manuel, Some tests of specification for panel data:monte carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

This study applies three commonly used estimators with panel data, namely OLS, FEM and REM, using data obtained from FiinPro (a data providing company) and Vietstock on 691 companies listed on Vietnam’s two stock exchanges from 2008 to 2015; This was a sensitive period of world financial crisis, and Vietnamese manufacturing firms had a really hard time to overcome the difficulty in a global economy downturn. This paper found that (1) firm size, growth opportunities and financial leverage negatively affect firm value; (2) there is no evidence that operating cash flow, cash liquidity and intellectual capital affect firm value; (3) the estimation results confirm the non-linear relationship (order 3) between the directors’ share ownership ratio and corporate value; (4) state ownership and foreign ownership ratios have a negative effect on Vietnamese listed manufacturing firms during the period, but (5) there is no optimal number of BOD members.

The number of females sit as board of directors are relatively low since there was no clear regulation to recruit them as board members or even serve at supervisory levels. Hence, this study aims to empirically investigate the effect of females’ board of directors on firm performance in Oman, a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The Return on Asset (ROA) and Tobin’s Q are used as proxies to measure firm’s performance for 63 non-financial firms registered on the Muscat Security Market (MSM) for the periods between 2016 and 2019. This study applied canonical analysis techniques in order to assess and answer the research hypotheses. The findings indicates that the hypotheses are rejected because ROA and Tobin’s Q are unrelated to the proportion of females as the board of directors, regardless of whether the firm size or firm age are being controlled. Thus, the results implied that more opportunities, empowerment and skills should be exposed or given to females to sit on the board and hence the number will increase accordingly. Future studies could also look at financial organizations as well in order to evaluate how female board representation affects financial success of the firms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audit Committee; Corporate Governance; Female Board Member; Firm Performance; Oman","","","","The authors would also like to thank you to the Innovation & Research Management Centre (iRMC) and the Institute of Energy Policy & Research (IEPRe) UNITEN for the funding and research collaboration for this research.","Bhagat, Sanjai, Size, leverage, and risk-taking of financial institutions, Journal of Banking and Finance, 59, pp. 520-537, (2015); Journal of Business Management, (2012); Chen, Jie, Female board representation, corporate innovation and firm performance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 48, pp. 236-254, (2018); Sabatier, Maréva, A women’s boom in the boardroom: effects on performance?, Applied Economics, 47, 26, pp. 2717-2727, (2015); Arun, Thankom G., Female directors and earnings management: Evidence from UK companies, International Review of Financial Analysis, 39, pp. 137-146, (2015); Academy of Management Journal, (2014); Gregory-Smith, Ian, Appointments, pay and performance in UK boardrooms by gender, Economic Journal, 124, 574, pp. F109-F128, (2014); Liu, Yu, Do women directors improve firm performance in China?, Journal of Corporate Finance, 28, pp. 169-184, (2014); Kiliç, Merve, The effect of board gender diversity on firm performance: evidence from Turkey, Gender in Management, 31, 7, pp. 434-455, (2016); Ali, Jabir, Does gender make a difference in business performance?: Evidence from a large enterprise survey data of India, Gender in Management, 32, 3, pp. 218-233, (2017)","","SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality","","","","","","15822559","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162673820"

We aim to examine the determinants of financial innovation and to verify whether financial innovation positively impacts economic growth, despite the prevalence of corruption in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Results show that the determinants of financial innovation in Sub-Saharan African countries are competitiveness and the crisis in the banking sector, the need to extend the portfolio of deposits and bank loans (financial inclusion), and increased internet access for households and investment. Similarly, corruption prevents the transmission of the positive effects of the financial system on economic growth, and reductions in corruption boost economic growth, so it will be important for policymakers to bear in mind that without the reduction and control of corruption in developing countries, financial innovation does not produce major advantages concerning the economic growth of African countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corruption; Economic Growth; Financial Innovation; Panel Data; Sub-saharan Africa","","","","This work was supported by the research unit on governance, competitiveness and public policy (UIDB/04058/2020), funded by national funds through FCT – fundação para a ciência e a tecnologia.","Governance Corruption and Economic Performance, (2002); Ajide, Folorunsho M., Can financial inclusion reduce the presence of corruption?

Companies' financial woes must be identified early to implement various bankruptcy avoidance strategies. This study discusses the optimization of the multi-layer perceptron ensemble stacking classifier hyperparameter by majority voting as a methodology for constructing a classification model for bankruptcy prediction (MLP-STM). The primary aim of this study is to create a reliable model for use in MLP-STM-based financial ratio analysis. The used MLP-STM model has successfully optimized the MLP hyperparameters, which is a substantial contribution and a novel aspect of our study. Training and evaluation data came from a multi-class dataset with labels such as ""distress area,"" ""grey area,"" ""safe area,"" and ""save area."" The training dataset is pre-processed to be well accepted by the learning ensemble. All performance models are evaluated using their confusion metrics and the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The primary conclusion of this study is that a novel MLP-STM classification model with varying hyperparameters can effectively classify features for detecting the performance of financially troubled businesses. When compared to the MLP-BAM and MLP-BOM models, the MLP-STM model performed best, with a 97% accuracy rate and a 100% AUC value.

The increasing moral consciousness of stakeholders has put pressure on companies, forcing these companies to include long-term policies that reflect the regionally specific needs of stakeholders. Using a structural topic model, this study identified differences between developing and developed countries with respect to sustainability disclosures. Data were obtained from 2100 sustainability reports published in the United Nations Global Compact database for the year 2020. In global terms, these sustainability reports addressed three main topics: 1) human rights, 2) diversity, equity, and inclusion, and 3) sustainable production. Moreover, the sustainability reports from developing and developed countries incorporated different communication strategies. Based on the prevalence (rate of occurrence) of content, sustainability reports from developed countries predominantly communicated issues related to “sustainable production” and “supply chain emissions”, whereas sustainability reports from developing countries more frequently communicated issues related to “education” and “human rights"". © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Developed Countries; Developing Counties; Human Rights; Structural Topic Modeling; Sustainability Report; Sustainable Production","","","","This study was supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) of FEM CULS in Prague, registration 2022B0009\u2014Application of artificial intelligence to regional segmentation using Big Data.","A Poisson Convolution Model for Characterizing Topical Content with Word Frequency and Exclusivity, (2012); Ali, Sadia Samar, Effectiveness of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in implementation of social sustainability in warehousing of developing countries: A hybrid approach, Journal of Cleaner Production, 324, (2021); Ali, Waris, Determinants of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Disclosure in Developed and Developing Countries: A Literature Review, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 24, 4, pp. 273-294, (2017); Amin, Marian H., CSR disclosure on Twitter: Evidence from the UK, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 40, (2021); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2015); García-Benau, María Antonia, Financial crisis impact on sustainability reporting, Management Decision, 51, 7, pp. 1528-1542, (2013); Aray, Yulia N., The hunt for international legitimacy: Examining the relationship between internationalization, state ownership, location and CSR reporting of Russian firms, International Business Review, 30, 5, (2021); Arıoğlu, Emrah, Board age and value diversity: Evidence from a collectivistic and paternalistic culture, Borsa Istanbul Review, 21, 3, pp. 209-226, (2021); Azzam, Mohammad Jamal, The association between sustainability disclosures and the financial performance of Jordanian firms, Cogent Business and Management, 7, 1, (2020); Bartikowski, Boris P., Attribute framing in CSR communication: Doing good and spreading the word – But how?, Journal of Business Research, 131, pp. 700-708, (2021)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","2296665X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152678302"

ESG-mandated investment has also been trending among investors. In Malaysia, the ESG-related index known as the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia (F4GBM) index was first launched in December 2014. This index prompted fund managers to use the benchmark as a measure of performance. However, there has been a lack of research on ESG-related pension funds. Hence, this study examines the impact of ESG investing on the investment portfolio of the Malaysian civil service pension fund. This pension fund is managed by the Retirement Fund Incorporated (Kumpulan Wang Persaraan Perbadanan; KWAP). Using quarterly data from 2017Q3 to 2022Q3, our results show, first, that KWAP has had a higher proportion of ESG-rated securities than of non-ESG-rated securities over the last five years. Secondly, ESG-rated stocks provide higher returns than non-rated stocks in KWAP's portfolio. Thirdly, ESG-rated securities have lower risk levels than non-ESG-rated securities. This study also found that ESG-rated securities provide a higher return per unit of risk relative to non-ESG-rated stocks. As a policy implication, ESG-rated investment has impacted the pension fund by providing higher returns and lower risk. This study contributes to the awareness of the benefits of ESG investing among state-funded pension schemes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Civil; Fiscal Budget; Forecasting; Malaysia; Pension Scheme; Servants Esg","","","","","Dyck, Alexander, Do institutional investors drive corporate social responsibility?

In this paper, a total of 3,181 sets of data representing the China’s green bond market and the government bond market for the period 2010–2022 are selected, and the VECM-DCC-VARMA-AGARCH model is used to analyse the spillover effects between the two in terms of information transmission and risk contagion. The results indicate that 1) The dynamic correlation between the China’s green bond market and the government bond market is significant, with obvious information transmission and risk contagion effects. 2) Compared to the government bond market, the green bond market is more sensitive to new information and the intensity of the reflection is stronger. 3) There is a long-term equilibrium relationship between the China’s green bond market and the government bond market, and the government bond market will adjust in the direction of green bonds through an error correction mechanism when deviations occur. 4) There is a significant two-way risk contagion effect between the green bond market and the government bond market, but the intensity of the effect is asymmetric. 5) The dynamic correlation between the green bond market and the government bond market has been deepening.

The results of the DY and BK approach show a weak connectedness between all Islamic banks rather than conventional banks of GCC. Subsample analysis of COVID-19 and GFC strengthens the total and short-oriented spillovers more than long-term spillovers. The global financial stress is exposed with the most substantial coherence, increasing the connectedness of Islamic banks in the short and long-oriented markets compared to conventional banks. The results of the study have practical implications for bankers, central banks, Islamic banks, policymakers, international economic institutions, banking investors, FIIs, DIIs, and academia.

Few studies have investigated whether EPU influences corporate green innovation. Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2005 to 2019, we find strong evidence that EPU is significantly and negatively associated with corporate green innovation. Our moderating effect analysis shows that financial constraints exacerbate the negative impact of EPU on green innovation, while government environmental subsidies can significantly mitigate the negative EPU effect. Moreover, the negative relationship between EPU and green innovation is salient in privately owned enterprises, firms with less industry competition, and firms in regions with weak intellectual property protection. This study has important implications for policymakers regarding increasing government expenditure on environmental protection and strengthening intellectual property protection to promote corporate green innovation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Green Innovation; Economic Policy Uncertainty; Financial Constraints; Intellectual Property Protection","","","","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the helpful comments from Sushanta Mallick (Editor), Associate Editor, Copy Editor, and the reviewers.

However, the mechanism of environmental degradation on green bonds has not yet been studied. This study proposes a mediation model to analyze air pollution's influence on green bonds. Theoretically, air pollution leads to increased public concern through public environmental awareness and perceptions of physical health risks. Enhanced public concern drives investors' green preference and environmental responsibility, thus expanding green bond demand, in which public concern plays an important mediation role. To verify the mediating effect, causal stepwise regression and bootstrap methods are used. The empirical results confirm this theoretical mechanism. Air pollution is significantly positively related to public concern. Public concern is positively linked with green bond investment willingness, resulting in increased volatility. The total positive effect of air pollution on green bonds is partly absorbed by the mediating effect of public concern that is significantly positive and reaches 30.21% of the total effect. In addition, major crisis events (e.g., COVID-19) may hinder the positive mediation process by generating a negative trend and distracting the public. This means that the government could propose appropriate measures to minimize the negative aspects in order to promote green finance. The mediation model is also useful for investors wishing to increase green assets in their portfolios and provides an incentive for businesses to promote green finance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Green Bond; Green Preference; Public Concern; Financial Markets; Health Risks; Investments; Risk Perception; Environmental Awareness; Environmental Perceptions; Environmental Responsibility; Green Bond; Green Preference; Mediating Effect; Physical Health; Public Concern; Stepwise Regression Method; Sustainable Investments; Air Pollution; Atmospheric Pollution; Environmental Degradation; Incentive; Investment; Public Attitude; Regression; Air And Air Related Phenomena; Air Pollution; Article; Bond Market; Conceptual Framework; Controlled Study; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Environmental Protection; Government; Particulate Matter 2.5; Social Responsibility; China; Human; Prevention And Control; Air Pollution; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Covid-19; Government; Humans","Financial markets; Health risks; Investments; Risk perception; Environmental awareness; Environmental perceptions; Environmental responsibility; Green bond; Green preference; Mediating effect; Physical health; Public concern; Stepwise regression method; Sustainable investments; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; environmental degradation; incentive; investment; public attitude; regression; air and air related phenomena; air pollution; Article; bond market; conceptual framework; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental protection; government; particulate matter 2.5; social responsibility; China; human; prevention and control; Air Pollution; Conservation of Natural Resources; COVID-19; Government; Humans","","","This work is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71991473 ).","Agliardi, Elettra, Financing environmentally-sustainable projects with green bonds, Environment and Development Economics, 24, 6, pp. 608-623, (2019); Agliardi, Elettra, Corporate Green Bonds: Understanding the Greenium in a Two-Factor Structural Model, Environmental and Resource Economics, 80, 2, pp. 257-278, (2021); Araújo, Jesús A., Particulate matter and atherosclerosis: Role of particle size, composition and oxidative stress, Particle and Fibre Toxicology, 6, (2009); Arif, Muhammad, Diversifier or more?

We posit that a long-term ownership horizon is an enabling but not sufficient condition for sustainability and propose owner stewardship as an important contingency. Research Findings/Insights: We review 161 articles on the relationship between corporate ownership and sustainability/CSR, published during 2017–2021 and not covered by previous reviews. We find (1) in most cases, a positive effect of institutional ownership on sustainability, particularly for long-term institutional investors; (2) in most cases, a positive effect of state ownership, seen as long-term-oriented; and (3) mixed results regarding family ownership, also seen as long-term-oriented. We also observe considerable heterogeneity in how prior research defines and measures the key constructs of our review. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Long-term ownership appears to be an enabling but not sufficient condition for corporate sustainability, and stewardship at the ownership level may be an important missing link. Furthermore, the wide variety of terminology and measures in the literature poses a challenge for knowledge accumulation. Efforts towards convergence and standardization seem important. Practitioner/Policy Implications: An exclusive focus on short-termism may be misleading. Business leaders and policymakers ought to consider other parameters, such as steward ownership. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Governance; Investment Horizon; Ownership; Stewardship; Sustainability","","","","We thank the four anonymous reviewers for their constructive engagement with our manuscript and the Editor, Prof. Till Talaulicar, for his editorial guidance.

Using the data in China, the difference-in-difference (DID) analysis explores whether the implementation of policies could change institutional investors’ attitude to environmental factors when making investment decisions. Considering the effect of investment horizons, we find that long-term institutional investors have shown symmetric preferences on green investment, while short-term institutions are more affected by green finance policies. Additionally, the mechanism analysis shows that green finance policies can influence the green investment of institutional investors not only by affecting stock price returns but also by increasing the innovation capabilities of green companies and thus improving corporate performance. Besides, heterogeneity and moderating effect analyses find that green finance policies can achieve better policy effects when financial institutions invest in non-state-owned enterprises, enterprises with higher quality of information disclosure and poor external supervision. The finding would extend the studies of green investment in emerging markets and present new evidence about the policy effect on institutions’ preferences for green investment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Information Disclosure; External Audits; Government Policies; Green Finance; Green Investment; Institutional Preferences; Decision Making; Finance; Heterogeneity; Innovation; Investment; China; Fiscal Policy; Government; Policy; Decision Making; Fiscal Policy; Government; Policy","decision making; finance; heterogeneity; innovation; investment; China; fiscal policy; government; policy; Decision Making; Fiscal Policy; Government; Policy","","","This work was supported by Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 2020J01461, 2021J01571), Fujian Provincial Social Science Planning Foundation of China (nos.

Correspondingly, the literature on social regulation—which describes how non-governmental stakeholders exert their regulatory influence on organizations—remains fragmented. To act as a springboard for future studies, this review examines the contribution of corporate reputation to our understanding of how CSI is socially regulated. Our analysis of a large (n = 448 studies) multidisciplinary body of literature unearths a set of nuanced relationships between CSI and corporate reputation. We synthesize a conceptual framework in order to map the diverse landscape of literature and its contributions. We then highlight important gaps among—as well as between—research streams to present a future research agenda. Accordingly, this review contributes to closing ‘the loop’ between CSI, corporate reputation and social regulation, thereby opening up new pathways for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Aguilera, Ruth, Connecting the Dots: Bringing External Corporate Governance into the Corporate Governance Puzzle, Academy of Management Annals, 9, 1, pp. 483-573, (2015); Aguilera, Ruth, The dubious role of institutions in international business: A road forward, Journal of International Business Studies, 50, 1, pp. 20-35, (2019); Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); Alexander, Cindy R., On the nature of the reputational penalty for corporate crime: Evidence, Journal of Law and Economics, 42, 2, pp. 489-526, (1999); Alsop, Ronald J., Corporate reputation: Anything but superficial – the deep but fragile nature of corporate reputation, Journal of Business Strategy, 25, 6, pp. 21-29, (2004); Antonetti, Paolo, An Extended Model of Moral Outrage at Corporate Social Irresponsibility, Journal of Business Ethics, 135, 3, pp. 429-444, (2016); Antonetti, Paolo, Identity Bias in Negative Word of Mouth Following Irresponsible Corporate Behavior: A Research Model and Moderating Effects, Journal of Business Ethics, 149, 4, pp. 1005-1023, (2018); Armour, John H., Regulatory Sanctions and Reputational Damage in Financial Markets, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 52, 4, pp. 1429-1448, (2017); Armstrong, J.

Using the event study methodology, a positive market reaction one day following the switch to a Big N auditor has been observed. The originality of this study lies in its context, as the UK audit market is currently the subject of considerable media attention with the debate of the merits of breaking up the big 4 audit firms considering the demise of the construction giant Carillion, while including the long period windows.

However, the empirical results presented in the extant literature are inconclusive at best. The inconclusive empirical results could be due to several factors and one of them could be that the relationship is contingent on some key factors. Given the rising trend of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) activities, in this paper the relationship between board diversity and the firm performance is tested in the context of ESG activities. The subject of examination in this study is the listed Chinese firms. The sample period spans for 6 years and is collected from 2014 to 2019. This work uses a dynamic approach to modelling relationships. The generalised method of moments (GMM) is used in a two-step system. An endogeneity-free estimate may be achieved by using this strategy. We can learn a great deal from these hypotheses. There is a positive and substantial correlation between board diversity and the firm's success, which suggests that diverse boards are beneficial to businesses. Both ESG activities and a positive coefficient on company performance are significant. This shows investors appreciate companies that are involved in ESG activities because they see this as an investment that pays off. Last but not least, the report shows that board diversity has a negative and considerable impact on ESG efforts. According to the results, board diversity and ESG efforts are not necessary for a company's success. According to the data, board diversity is not particularly beneficial in the context of significant ESG initiatives. Board diversity really hurts a company's success when it engages in high ESG activities. The study also discusses the work's policy ramifications. Finally, the work lays out a clear path for further study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Diversity; Esg Activities; Firm Performance; Empirical Analysis; Firm Size; Governance Approach; Investment; Performance Assessment; Strategic Approach; China","empirical analysis; firm size; governance approach; investment; performance assessment; strategic approach; China","","","","Abdallah, Wissam, Endogeneity: How Failure to Correct for it can Cause Wrong Inferences and Some Remedies, British Journal of Management, 26, 4, pp. 791-804, (2015); Achim, Monica Violeta, Does technology matter for combating economic and financial crime?

However, tensions between these objectives can make this a challenging task and lead towards mission drift. This work investigates if the cultural dimension can forecast the mission drift. We empirically analyze this relationship in three stages. In the first stage, we identify a homogeneous dataset of 287 sustainable SEs from seven EU countries from 2011 to 2020. Then, in the second stage, we apply the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology to calculate the efficiency of the SEs. An efficient SE has to simultaneously achieve social, environmental, and economic aims. We calculate a proxy of the mission drift and generate a dichotomous category variable that assigns value 1 to the SE not affected by mission drift, 0 otherwise. In the last stage, we implement the 2SLS logistic regression between the variable that identifies the SEs affected by mission drift and three cultural dimensions: avoidance of uncertainty, masculinity, and short-term orientation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultural Variables; Data Envelopment Analysis; Endogeneity; Hofstede; Masculinity; Mission Drift; Performance Measurement; Social Entrepreneurship; Uncertainty Avoidance; Cultural Geography; Data Envelopment Analysis; Empirical Analysis; Entrepreneur; Masculinization; Regression Analysis; Europe","cultural geography; data envelopment analysis; empirical analysis; entrepreneur; masculinization; regression analysis; Europe","","","Open Access Funding provided by Universita degli Studi del Sannio within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.","Adams, Renée B., Understanding the relationship between founder-CEOs and firm performance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 16, 1, pp. 136-150, (2009); Agasisti, Tommaso, Measuring the efficiency of European education systems by combining Data Envelopment Analysis and Multiple-Criteria Evaluation, Journal of Productivity Analysis, 51, 2-3, pp. 105-124, (2019); Ahen, Frederick, Critical perspectives on strategic CSR: What is sustainable value co-creation orientation?, Critical Perspectives on International Business, 11, 1, pp. 92-109, (2015); Ahern, Kenneth R., Lost in translation?

Boards with more female directors exhibit lower investment inefficiency, resulting in better allocating firms’ resources and higher firm performance.

To address this issue, we use both quantitative and qualitative methods. First, through quantitative analyses on a sample of 117 workforce reductions announced by 101 French listed firms from 2007 to 2012, we shed light how, by not taking accounting strategies into account in their models, prior mainstream studies may have conveyed false knowledge about improved performances after the operation and performed the workforce reduction efficiency supported by economic theories. Second, through a case study, we provide an in-depth illustration of the performativity effect of these accounting strategies and more precisely of downward earnings management, which can be considered a calculation act that contributes to performing the myth of the efficiency of these operations. Overall, this paper contributes to the workforce reduction literature by providing a critical illustration of how accounting numbers construct efficiency through the performative role given to earnings management. It also contributes to the critical accounting project by notably participating in the debate on the use of quantitative and mixed research methodologies in the critical accounting project. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Language; Critical Accounting; Earnings Management; Performativity; Workforce Reductions","","","","The authors sincerely thank the following for their constructive remarks: the editor, Christine Cooper, the two anonymous reviewers, Giovanna Michelon, Den Patten and the participants of the TSM-Research Accounting seminars.","Aerts, Walter, Causal disclosures on earnings and earnings management in an IPO setting, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 30, 5, pp. 431-459, (2011); Aerts, Walter, Management's causal reasoning on performance and earnings management, European Management Journal, 32, 5, pp. 770-783, (2014); Aggeri, Franck, How can performativity contribute to management and organization researc?: Theoretical Perspectives and analytical framework, Management (France), 20, 1, pp. 28-69, (2017); Handbook of Organization Studies, (1996); Amernic, Joel H., Roles and Social Construction of Accounting in Industrial Relations, Journal of Industrial Relations, 47, 1, pp. 77-92, (2005); Andreicovici, Ionela, Two Wrongs Make a ‘Right’?

Design/Methodology/Approach: Huber White's Robust method in the LS technique is employed in this study to examine the impacts of corporate governance mechanisms and ownership structure on firm performance of Chinese dual-listed companies. To do so, we select 100 Chinese dual-listed companies consisting of 941 firm-year observations from 2003 to 2019 in our study, use both ROA and ROE to proxy the firm performance, and introduce a state control firm attribute, a binary variable representing ownership rights plus manipulation rights of China government, in the regression model to compare its effects on firm performance with that of state ownership. Findings: In our paper, we find that the independent variable having significant associations with both ROA and ROE in the same sign significantly influences the firm performance of Chinese dual-listed companies. The regression results show that both the independent director ratio and board size worsen the firm performance in terms of both ROE and ROA, respectively, but they do not contribute to the mitigation of agency costs or the improvement of firm performance. However, we do not observe any legal bonding effects on the firm performance in this study. On the other hand, we find that contrary to the consensus of CEO duality's negative effects on firm performance in literature, CEO duality positively influences the firm performance in terms of both ROA and ROE. Besides, foreign ownership is found to be positively related to firm performance in terms of ROA only, while state ownership is found to insignificantly and negatively influences firm performance. However, the state control firm attribute, representing the ownership rights and manipulation rights of China government, positively influences the firm performance in terms of both ROA and ROE. Thus, we conclude that the CEO duality and the state control firm attribute are the two determinant factors that positively influence Chinese dual-listed companies' firm performance. China's domestic private ownership significantly and positively associates with ROE, while the firm size exhibits a significant and positive influence on the firm performance in terms of both ROA and ROE. In contrast, the influence of the leverage ratio on firm performance is negative and is opposite to that of firm size, the financial firm attribute negatively relates to ROA, and no significant influence on firm performance is found in stock return volatility. Originality/Value: The research results complement the prior papers related to the fields of cross-listing and firm performance in literature. The findings in our paper are useful for investors to evaluate the firm performance of Chinese dual-listed companies, and for policymakers to enhance the listing rules and laws to ensure Chinese companies' independent directors and other board members act diligently to improve the firm performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Costs; Board Structure; Corporate Governance; Cross-listing; Firm Performance; Legal Bonding; Ownership Structure","","","","","Asian Journal of Economics and Banking, (2021); Abdallah, Abed Al Nasser, Why do firms cross-list?

Research Design & Methods: The researchers created an online questionnaire and gained data from 1221 Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian SMEs. Moreover, the researchers applied ordinal logistic regression analyses to achieve the goal of this study. Findings: According to the results, the impact of competitiveness on the bankruptcy risk perception of SMEs differ depending on the countries where they operate. Concerning the impact of innovativeness on financial performance and financial risk management, this article also proves that international differences between SMEs exist. Implications & Recommendations: The developments in the financial literacy of company executives and their managerial experiences and the improvements in credit access conditions, intellectual property rights, and tax legislation can make SMEs reduce their concerns about their financial risks. Thus, policymakers’ im-plementations are crucial to providing equal opportunities for SMEs even if they operate in various markets. Contribution & Value Added: This current research does not only make international comparisons among the investigated variables but also analyses the impacts of entrepreneurial competencies on various indicators of financial risk. These facts not only make this research become a unique study in the literature but also the reason why it should garner the interest of prospective readers such as policymakers, academicians, and SME owners. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competitiveness; Financial Performance, Smes; Financial Risk; Innovativeness","","","","The journal is co-financed in the years 2022-2024 by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Poland in the framework of the ministerial programme “Development of Scientific Journals” (RCN) on the basis of contract no.

Panel data of 1914 observations from the UK and Turkey from 2016 to 2021 with a fixed effect model are used to estimate the results. The findings reveal that ESG indicators associate significantly with firms’ value. However, ESG indicators exhibit a stronger significant association with Tobin’s Q than stock prices and market-to-book value. This indicates that sustainability indicators are linked to the firm’s overall market value and the long-term run market valuation rather than just the stock market value. The results also reveal that while board independence, board expertise, and diversity exhibit a significant and positive association with firms’ value, board size negatively affects firms’ value.

For aggregation of year wise rankings popular methods like Borda count and Copeland methods have been applied. A comparison of results of the LOPCOW-EDAS model with other MCDM methods has been made. It is noticed that the firms which held the overall top positions prior to COVID-19 suffer more afterward than the bottom performers. However, there has not been any major effect of COVID-19 on firms’ financial health and long-term growth prospect.

We use the Chinese listed company data as the bases for adopting an event-study method to identify the impact of ESG performance on cumulative abnormal returns. Empirical results suggest that ESG performance significantly increases firms’ cumulative abnormal returns and has asymmetric effects during the pandemic. Our results are robust to various robustness checks that consider the replacement of event window period, ESG measurement, adding other control variables, and sample exclusion of Hubei Province. We further find that reputation and insurance effects are important mechanisms through which ESG performance influences stock prices.

The GMM estimator’s method was applied on the dataset of Dhaka Stock Exchange listed firms during the period 2013 to 2018. The sample contains 310 firms with 1860 firm years. The study reveals that CG, FP, and REVA characteristics are significantly conjuncted with FV and RoS. Firms, regardless of size, age, and nature, adopting good CG within business management practice can significantly improve FP and continuously generate positive economic value for both firms and shareholders over the period, thus enhance FV and RoS. Moreover, firms confirming continuous growth of FV are able to provide positive RoS to shareholders. This study ensures necessary guidelines for both firms’ manager and investors, as managers will be encouraged to implement good CG within the firms and confirmed to maintain healthy FP and continues REVA growth for the firm.

The results revealed that the performance subsequent of mergers is not significantly different for the merged companies. But in comparison to control sample of companies without mergers for the examined period, the results reveal that merger transactions signalize a more stable profitability and better performance for the companies with mergers. Furthermore, merger events signalize different performance levels during and after the crisis: mergers that took place when there was no economic crisis are far more profitable and lead to better performance from mergers during the period of economic crisis. Last, regarding the industry relatedness of the merged firms, the industry type and the merger combination of merged companies, there is not any impact from them on the post-merger performance in the examined accounting measures.

Design/methodology/approach: This study introduces reverse unrestricted mixed-data sampling (RUMIDAS) to support vector regression (SVR) to develop a novel RUMIDAS-SVR model. The RUMIDAS-SVR model was estimated using a quadratic programming problem. The authors then use the novel RUMIDAS-SVR model to forecast the development performance of all high-tech listed companies, an important sector of the economy reflecting the potential and dynamism of urban economic development in Shanghai using the mixed-frequency consumer price index (CPI) producer price index (PPI), and consumer confidence index (CCI) as predictors. Findings: The empirical results show that the established RUMIDAS-SVR is superior to the competing models with regard to mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and multi-source macroeconomic predictors contribute to the development performance forecast of important economies. Practical implications: Smart city policy makers should create a favourable macroeconomic environment, such as controlling inflation or stabilising prices for companies within the city, and companies within the important city economic sectors should take initiative to shoulder their responsibility to support the construction of the smart city. Originality/value: This study contributes to smart city monitoring by proposing and developing a new model, RUMIDAS-SVR, to help the construction of smart cities. It also empirically provides strategic insights for smart city stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","High-tech Listed Companies; Mixed-frequency Data; Rumidas-svr; Smart City; Economic And Social Effects; Economics; Forecasting; Quadratic Programming; Smart City; Data Driven; Development Performance; Frequency Data; High Tech; High-tech Listed Company; Mixed Data Samplings; Mixed-frequency Data; Reverse Unrestricted Mixed-data Sampling-support Vector Regression; Support Vector Regression Models; Support Vector Regressions; Mean Square Error","Economic and social effects; Economics; Forecasting; Quadratic programming; Smart city; Data driven; Development performance; Frequency data; High tech; High-tech listed company; Mixed data samplings; Mixed-frequency data; Reverse unrestricted mixed-data sampling-support vector regression; Support vector regression models; Support vector regressions; Mean square error","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021M700380), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71729001, 72025101), the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (20YJA630024), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. FRF-DF-20-11).","Wen Jiabao Premier of the State Council Let Science and Technology Lead China S Sustainable Development, (2009); Albulescu, Claudiu Tiberiu, Stock prices, inflation and inflation uncertainty in the U.S.: testing the long-run relationship considering Dow Jones sector indexes, Applied Economics, 49, 18, pp. 1794-1807, (2017); Anari, Ali, Stock prices and inflation, Journal of Financial Research, 24, 4, pp. 587-602, (2001); Antonakakis, Nikolaos, Has the correlation of inflation and stock prices changed in the United States over the last two centuries?, Research in International Business and Finance, 42, pp. 1-8, (2017); Asgharian, Hossein, The importance of the macroeconomic variables in forecasting stock return variance: A GARCH-MIDAS approach, Journal of Forecasting, 32, 7, pp. 600-612, (2013); Baffǐgi, Alberto, Bridge models to forecast the euro area GDP, International Journal of Forecasting, 20, 3, pp. 447-460, (2004); Bams, Dennis, Does oil and gold price uncertainty matter for the stock market?, Journal of Empirical Finance, 44, pp. 270-285, (2017); Baskar, S., Attribute-based data fusion for designing a rational trust model for improving the service reliability of internet of things assisted applications in smart cities, Soft Computing, 25, 18, pp. 12275-12289, (2021); Bhuiyan, Erfan M., Macroeconomic variables and stock market indices: Asymmetric dynamics in the US and Canada, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 77, pp. 62-74, (2020); Bonhomme, Stéphane, Nonparametric estimation of non-exchangeable latent-variable models, Journal of Econometrics, 201, 2, pp. 237-248, (2017)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02635577","","IMDSD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134602165"

Assessing performance towards sustainability issues, including environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG), and its’ relevance in firm value in the banking sector offers a field of continuous interest for researchers. This paper investigates the role of ESG materiality in firm value, based on a sample of banks operating in OECD countries, for the period 2016–2020. Adopting the materiality classification for the banking sector provided by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the study consists of a multi-layer methodology. In the first stage, a dynamic technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and entropy methods are utilized to calculate ESG score based on ESG materiality for 1115 bank-year observations while in the second stage, value relevance analyses are applied in order to reveal whether ESG materiality affects firm value. The results depict that ESG performance based on ESG materiality has a positive influence on the firm value for both models, price-to-book value ratio (PBV), and Tobin’s Q (TQ). Moreover, collected from the Refinitiv database, ESG combined has a low impact on PBR whereas there is no significant effect on TQ. The implication is that the firm value is influenced by the materiality-adjusted ESG performance than by the extended ESG spectrum. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Sector; Dynamic Entropy; Dynamic Topsis; Esg Materiality; Firm Value; Oecd; Banking; Climate Change; Firm Size; Oecd; Sustainability","banking; climate change; firm size; OECD; sustainability","","","This study was supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), under the Project Number: 120K901.","undefined; undefined; Announcement of Gfanz at Cop26; Harvard Business Review, (2019); Time has Come the Kpmg Survey of Corporate Sustainability Reporting; Aras, Güler, Finance, Sustainability, and Business Legitimacy, pp. 1131-1145, (2020); Perrini, Francesco, Deconstructing the Relationship Between Corporate Social and Financial Performance, Journal of Business Ethics, 102, SUPPL., pp. 59-76, (2011); Khan, Mozaffar, Corporate sustainability: First evidence on materiality, Accounting Review, 91, 6, pp. 1697-1724, (2016); Do Sustainable Banks Outperform Driving Value Creation Through Esg Practices Report of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values Gabv; Impact of Esg Factor Materiality on Stock Performance of Firms Erasmus Platform for Sustainable Value Creation Working Paper","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142724325"

Both have drastically changed the way companies operate. High-growth companies (HGCs) can be an important group because of their characteristics and can provide guidelines for efficiently addressing these challenges and creating new opportunities. Our research contributes to this field, as the objective of the article is to find out whether the global challenges (i.e., the COVID-19 and Ukraine–Russia crisis) lead to a difference in the strength of the influence between the analyzed determinants—the growth factors of HGCs. For this purpose, a structural model equation (SEM) was applied and a multigroup analysis between the two data sets (before and during the global challenges) was performed on the pooled sample of n = 242 HGCs from the Republic of Slovenia. The results showed some statistically significant differences that can be explained by the time perspective and possibly by the influence of global challenges. Thus, this paper makes an important contribution to science, as a reassessment of the theories and implicit assumptions in current research is needed due to global challenges. It is also useful for policy makers who want to consider the impact of recent global challenges in their policy recommendations and for HGCs seeking sustainable high growth. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Global Challenges; High-growth Company; Covid-19; Equation; Global Climate; Recovery; Strength; Russian Federation; Slovenia; Ukraine","COVID-19; equation; global climate; recovery; strength; Russian Federation; Slovenia; Ukraine","","","","High Growth Enterprises in the Covid 19 Crisis Context, (2021); Theory of the Growth of the Firm, (1959); Močnik, Dijana, Growth aspirations of early-stage entrepreneurs: Empirical investigation of south-eastern and western european countries, Journal of East European Management Studies, 21, 3, pp. 298-317, (2016); Gilbert, Brett Anitra, New venture growth: A review and extension, Journal of Management, 32, 6, pp. 926-950, (2006); O’Gorman, Colm, The sustainability of growth in small- and medium-sized enterprises, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behaviour and Research, 7, 2, pp. 60-75, (2001); Frešer, Blaž, Financial Determinants of High-Growth Companies: A Conceptual Model, pp. 1-160, (2020); Nahapiet, Janine E., Social capital, intellectual capital, and the organizational advantage, Academy of Management Review, 23, 2, pp. 242-266, (1998); Almeida, Fernando Luis F., The Challenges and Opportunities in the Digitalization of Companies in a Post-COVID-19 World, IEEE Engineering Management Review, 48, 3, pp. 97-103, (2020); Kraus, Patrick, Cultural Antecedents of Sustainability and Regional Economic Development - A Study of SME ‘Mittelstand’ Firms in Baden-Württemberg (Germany), Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 32, 7-8, pp. 629-653, (2020); Niesr Policy Paper, (2022)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142716317"

The proposed method is based on combining two MCDM methods: Extended Best–Worst (EBW) and Multiple Reference Point (MRP) methods. We formulate the problem of finding a priority vector from a set of interval pairwise comparisons applying an EBW method which allows the decision maker (DM) to use interval values in order to describe the relative importance of one criterion over another. The EBW method, using fuzzy set theory, can successfully handle the vagueness and ambiguity present in the judgments. Lastly, the MRP method is employed to obtain an overall score for each company using the weights established at the first stage. A case study is presented to rank Spanish non-life insurance companies based on the constructed model. Since the evaluation of insurance companies involves a great number of indicators, it is a complex MCDM issue.

In this study, we first examine the direct impact of EIs on GI. Moreover, we consider political uncertainty (PU) as a factor that increases uncertainty and consider marketization degree (MD) and environmental regulations (ERs) as two other factors that decrease uncertainty; then, we examine the effects of these factors on EIs and GI. Using key environmental cities in China covering the period from 2003 to 2016 as the research sample, the empirical results indicate that EIs can have a positive effect on GI and two different types of GI (green invention and green utility). In addition, PU can weaken the positive effect of EIs on GI. Furthermore, the association between EIs and GI varies with the intensity of ERs but does not vary with MD. The positive effect of EIs on GI is more pronounced in cities with a higher intensity of ERs. Overall, PU that increases uncertainty can weaken the positive effect of EIs on GI, whereas ERs that decrease uncertainty can strengthen the promotion effect of EIs on GI. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Investments; Environmental Regulations; Green Innovation; Marketization Degree; Political Uncertainty; Environmental Economics; Environmental Policy; Innovation; Investment; Urban Economy; Urban Policy; China","environmental economics; environmental policy; innovation; investment; urban economy; urban policy; China","","","This research was funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (no. 2021M691599) and Postdoctoral Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province (no. 2021K452C).","Adams, Richard J., Sustainability-oriented Innovation: A Systematic Review, International Journal of Management Reviews, 18, 2, pp. 180-205, (2016); Arena, Claudia, Big Egos Can Be Green: A Study of CEO Hubris and Environmental Innovation, British Journal of Management, 29, 2, pp. 316-336, (2018); Bai, Yu, Can environmental innovation benefit from outward foreign direct investment to developed countries?

With the rise of behavioral finance, it has become a new direction to study the influence of managers’ “irrational characteristics” on enterprise overinvestment. With the rapid rise of the media industry, media reporting, as an external governance mechanism, supplements the capital market supervision system and has a huge impact on the investment behavior of enterprises. How media reports affects overinvestment and whether it can curb overinvestment caused by managers’ overconfidence is still worthy of further study. This paper took 6,012 A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2021 as samples, and based on the perspective of “media reports,” studies the impact of managers’ overconfidence on overinvestment; explores whether positive and negative media reports have a moderating effect between overconfidence and overinvestment; studies the moderating effect of media reports under different marketization processes. Empirical conclusions: (1) Managers’ overconfidence will lead to overinvestment of enterprises. (2) Positive media reports will aggravate the overinvestment caused by managers’ overconfidence; negative reports can inhibit the overinvestment caused by managers’ overconfidence. (3) In regions with higher marketization, positive media reports play a more significant role in aggravating overconfidence and leading to overinvestment; in regions with lower marketization, negative reports play a stronger role in restraining overconfidence and overinvestment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Enterprise Overinvestment; External Governance; Managers’ Overconfidence; Marketization Process; Media Reports","","","","","Ahmed, Bilal, Does firm life cycle impact corporate investment efficiency?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 1, pp. 1-13, (2021); Akbar, Ahsan, Does corporate environmental investment impede financial performance of Chinese enterprises?

Over the course of the 1990s, a time period in which shareholder value orientation gained momentum, downsizing became an institutionalized management practice. We argue and propose that the growing legitimacy of this practice is displayed in investors' reactions to downsizing announcements. Using a sample of 391 downsizing announcements of the S&P 100 firms for the period 1990-2006, we show that the announcement year has a positive (diminishing) effect on the abnormal stock market return and that prior downsizings in the focal firm's institutional field have a positive linear impact on abnormal stock market return. In addition, we provide evidence that these relationships are positively moderated by proactive downsizing motives and firm size. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the performance effects of corporate downsizing and investors' role in legitimizing this prevalent business practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Markets; Firm Strategy; Institutionalism; Shareholders; Valuation","","","","The work was supported by a travel grant from the Fritz Thyssen Foundation for a research stay of one of the authors at UC Irvine.","Academy of Management Review, (1991); Abrahamson, Eric, Management fashion, Academy of Management Review, 21, 1, pp. 254-285, (1996); Ahmadjian, Christina L., A clash of capitalisms: Foreign shareholders and corporate restructuring in 1990s Japan, American Sociological Review, 70, 3, pp. 451-471, (2005); Ahmadjian, Christina L., Safety in numbers: Downsizing and the deinstitutionalization of permanent employment in Japan, Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, 4, pp. 622-654, (2001); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Academy of Management Review, (1994); Alvesson, Mats, Neo-Institutional Theory and Organization Studies: A Mid-Life Crisis?, Organization Studies, 40, 2, pp. 199-218, (2019); Financial Management, (1986); Cbs News, (1998); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Talking trash: Legitimacy, impression management, and unsystematic risk in the context of the natural environment, Academy of Management Journal, 47, 1, pp. 93-103, (2004)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","14751461","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159660229"

This study applies the Malmquist-DEA model to assess the efficiency of green technology innovation in 19 Chinese wastewater treatment companies between 2017 and 2020. In addition, focus is placed on the core wastewater treatment technology of the companies with excellent performance, indicating how wastewater treatment companies may improve their green technology. The results of the study indicate that, first, the overall effectiveness of green technology innovation in companies follows a rising and then decreasing trend. In 2020, wastewater treatment companies’ green technology innovation efficiency was around 17.4 percent lower than in 2017. Improving technical progress is the key to boosting the total factor productivity of wastewater treatment companies. Second, based on the Tobit regression, the shareholding ratio of companies has a positive influence on the technical efficiency of companies. Therefore, China should increase innovation capacity and productivity, adopt current sewage treatment technology from overseas, and thus gradually achieve clean sewage utilization and ecological environment management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Green Technology Innovation; Malmquist-dea; Vibrating Membrane Technology; Wastewater Treatment","","","","This research was funded by the Major Projects of National Social Science Fund, grant number 20&ZD205; the Projects of National Social Science Fund, grant number 19CFX052; Research project of State Intellectual Property Office of China, grant number SS21-B-015; The National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71974144; The fund of the Key Laboratory of Cities’ Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change in Shanghai, grant number QHBHSYS201906.","Shannon, Mark A., Science and technology for water purification in the coming decades, Nature, 452, 7185, pp. 301-310, (2008); Zhao, Xin, Challenges toward carbon neutrality in China: Strategies and countermeasures, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 176, (2022); Shrivastava, Paul, Environmental technologies and competitive advantage, Strategic Management Journal, 16, 1 S, pp. 183-200, (1995); Braun, Ernest, Regulation as a Means for the Social Control of Technology, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 6, 3, pp. 259-272, (1994); Przychodzen, Justyna, Relationships between eco-innovation and financial performance - Evidence from publicly traded companies in Poland and Hungary, Journal of Cleaner Production, 90, pp. 253-263, (2015); Xu, Xiaofeng, The Effect of R&D Input on Operating Income of Chinese Wastewater Treatment Companies—With Patent Performance as a Mediating Variable, Water (Switzerland), 14, 6, (2022); Zhang, Wei, R&D investment and distress risk, Journal of Empirical Finance, 32, pp. 94-114, (2014); Lu, Lu, Wastewater treatment for carbon capture and utilization, Nature Sustainability, 1, 12, pp. 750-758, (2018); Shen, Kaiwen, Circular economy model for recycling waste resources under government participation: A case study in industrial waste water circulation in China, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 26, 1, pp. 21-47, (2020); Proceedings, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","22978739","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140632341"

The outbreak poses threats and opportunities for businesses in various countries including Indonesia. Subsequently, companies must adapt to address the consequences of the economic disruption and lockdown policies imposed by the local government. The study sample comprised companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021. Fixed effects model regression was employed to examine the effect of family, government, and institutional ownership on company performance. The results showed that family and institutional ownership positively affected company performance during the pandemic. The mechanisms of direct supervision and control by family members could potentially increase the benefits of their businesses. Furthermore, high institutional ownership makes the role of investors substantial in reducing business risk and increasing company performance. Furthermore, the results revealed that government ownership negatively affected company performance. As owners, the government has different strategic objectives, where companies are more oriented toward better public services than financial gains. Therefore, it is essential to consider the impact of shareholder involvement on company performance, especially during a pandemic because they are treated differently. The research suggests that organizations are responding and adapting to the uncertainties in the business environment they face through a variety of mechanisms, including developing public and corporate governance strategies to prepare for and respond to future emergencies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Company Performance; During Covid-19 Pandemic; Indonesia; Ownership Structure; Panel Data Model","","","","This research was funded by the Research University Grant of Sebelas Maret University, Number 254/UN27.22/PT.01.03/2022, and The APC was funded by the Research University Grant of Sebelas Maret University.","Jordan Journal of Business Administration, (2010); Adams, Renée B., Understanding the relationship between founder-CEOs and firm performance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 16, 1, pp. 136-150, (2009); Journal of Political Economy, (1994); Ahsan, Tanveer, How to deal with policy uncertainty to attain sustainable growth: the role of corporate governance, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 21, 1, pp. 78-91, (2021); Albuquerque, Rui, Resiliency of environmental and social stocks: An analysis of the exogenous COVID-19 market crash, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, 9, 3, pp. 593-621, (2020); Al-Janadi, Yaseen, Ownership Structure and Firm Performance in the Middle East: A Meta-Analysis, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 14, 12, (2021); Asian Journal of Finance Accounting, (2014); Alam, Md Mahmudul, Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on national security issues: Indonesia as a case study, Security Journal, 35, 4, pp. 1067-1086, (2022); Alchian, Armen A., The Property Right Paradigm, Journal of Economic History, 33, 1, pp. 16-27, (1973); Amin, Anisa Abdulrahman, Evaluating the effect of ownership structure on firm performance: evidence from Saudi Arabian listed companies, Journal of Economic Cooperation and Development, 39, 3, pp. 65-92, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140576860"

This study investigates whether investment-related attitudes and demographic profiles are related to robo-advisor clients’ sustainable investment choices. This paper describes an empirical study that uses a logistic regression model to investigate sustainable investment preferences at the individual investor level. Cross-sectional data consisting of 27,771 individual investors in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, who purchased investment products through a robo-advisor application, are used in this study. The results suggest that, concerning investment-related attitudes, robo-advisor clients with low-risk tolerance and a short investment horizon are more likely to choose to become sustainable investors. Furthermore, sustainable investments are preferred by robo-advisor clients who are less wealthy, female, and older. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Wealth Management; Investment Horizon; Risk–return Preference; Robo-advisor; Sociodemographic Factors; Sustainable Investment; Investment; Public Attitude; Risk Assessment; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Finland; Norway; Sweden","investment; public attitude; risk assessment; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Finland; Norway; Sweden","","","","undefined; undefined; Busch, Timo, Sustainable Development and Financial Markets: Old Paths and New Avenues, Business and Society, 55, 3, pp. 303-329, (2016); undefined; Fu, Yufen, Ethical Investing Has No Portfolio Performance Cost, Research in International Business and Finance, 52, (2020); Jafri, Juvaria, When billions meet trillions: impact investing and shadow banking in Pakistan, Review of International Political Economy, 26, 3, pp. 520-544, (2019); Knoll, Michael S., Ethical screening in modern financial markets: The conflicting claims underlying socially responsible investment, Business Lawyer, 57, 2, pp. 681-726, (2002); Lewis, Alan, Morals, money, ethical investing and economic psychology, Human Relations, 53, 2, pp. 179-191, (2000); Are Ethical Investments Good, (2014); Camilleri, Mark A., The market for socially responsible investing: a review of the developments, Social Responsibility Journal, 17, 3, pp. 412-428, (2020)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139780258"

This study uses a sample of non-financial listed companies from 2000 to 2020 and applies the staggered difference-in-differences technique to eliminate the endogeneity problem. Findings show that ESG disclosure has a favorable effect on corporate financial performance. This conclusion remains robust after a series of robustness tests, including the parallel trend test, Goodman-Bacon decomposition, replacement of dependent variables, system GMM estimate, the placebo test, etc. ESG disclosure has heterogeneous effects on financial performance. The positive effect of ESG disclosure on corporate financial performance is more pronounced in companies with ESG investors and companies with longer inception, high media attention, and high agency costs. In addition, investors with ESG preferences exert a substantial moderating effect on the link between ESG disclosure and financial performance connection. We arrive at two conclusions in the extended analysis. One is that ESG disclosure attracts ESG investors. Another is that ESG investors also play a positive moderating role in the connection between ESG ratings and financial performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esg; Financial Performance; Goodman-bacon Decomposition; Investor Preference; Staggered Difference-in-differences Method","","","","We thank the support provided by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [Grant No. 2021B1515020103 ] and the Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs for Doctoral Students of Jinan University [Grant No. 2021CXB025 ].","Abdi, Yaghoub, Exploring the impact of sustainability (ESG) disclosure on firm value and financial performance (FP) in airline industry: the moderating role of size and age, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 4, pp. 5052-5079, (2022); Angrist, Joshua D., Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion, (2008); Aouadi, Amal, Do ESG Controversies Matter for Firm Value?

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative approach. In-depth interviews were conducted with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders of IMFBs in Indonesia. The primary stakeholders interviewed comprised the board of directors of IMFBs located in several provinces in Indonesia, including rural and urban areas. The external stakeholders were the regulators/supervisors, represented by the Indonesian Financial Services Authority and Sharīʿah advisors of the National Sharīʿah Board as well as Muslim scholars. The data were analysed using CAQDAS, a computer-assisted tool for qualitative analysis. Findings: The objectives of the IMFBs are seen to represent more than profits or economic well-being. Their objectives also comprise spirituality and daʿwah (Islamic propagation). Daʿwah is conducted through the provision of funding and services that are aligned with Sharīʿah (Islamic law), the dissemination of information about Islamic financing, which is based on Islamic values and principles, and the payment of zakat (Islamic alms) and charitable contributions. The measures of performance are considered to be more holistic than those of conventional banks. Profit and growth are deemed important as the means to achieve social well-being objectives. Research limitations/implications: Better insights into the objectives and measures of IMFBs could be achieved from interviews with other stakeholder categories, such as customers and the community. This could be the focus of future research. Originality/value: This study added a new discussion to the limited empirical literature on IMFBs by investigating the views of stakeholders on the objectives and performance of IMFBs in Indonesia. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Indonesia; Islamic Microfinance Banks (imfbs); Islamic Microfinance Institutions (imfis); Islamic Social Finance; Performance","","","","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for the funding of this research under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (Project Code: FRGS/1/2018/SS01/USM/01/1).","International Journal of Business and Social Research, (2013); Abdullah, Md Faruk, Is there any difference between islamic and conventional microfinance?

Under the constraints of carbon emission reduction, the question of how to achieve the sustainable development of new energy enterprises has become an important issue among managers and investors. This study selects Chinese listed companies in the new energy industry as the research sample, employs the DID method and uses panel data to explore the role of carbon neutrality commitment in the sustainable growth of new energy companies. The results show that the carbon neutrality commitment has greatly improved the sustainable development of Chinese new energy companies, with the internal profitability and external investor sentiment of the enterprises being important mediating variables. Moreover, the effect of the carbon neutrality commitment on the sustainable growth of non-state-owned new energy firms is much more significant compared with that of state-owned enterprises, and the effect is more robust in the east than in the central and western regions. Based on the conclusions, this study provides practical implications for managers, investors and policymakers in order to promote the sustainable growth of new energy firms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Neutrality Commitment; Heterogeneity; Mediating Effect; New Energy Companies; Sustainable Development; Carbon Emission; Emission Control; Heterogeneity; Panel Data; Policy Implementation; Profitability; Sustainable Development; China","carbon emission; emission control; heterogeneity; panel data; policy implementation; profitability; sustainable development; China","","","This research was funded by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2019RW23 & BLX202121), The Double first-class construction project of Beijing Forestry University (No. 2022XKJS0305), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities—Beijing Forestry University Science and Technology Innovation project (No. 2021STWM23), The Ministry of education of humanities and social science project (No. 20YJA790059) and National Social Science Fund of China (No. 20FGLB022 & 19BGL052).","Qi, Xiaoyuan, Energy quota trading can achieve energy savings and emission reduction: evidence from China’s pilots, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 37, pp. 52431-52458, (2021); Huang, Weibin, Carbon footprint of cotton production in China: Composition, spatiotemporal changes and driving factors, Science of the Total Environment, 821, (2022); Peng, Jiaying, Heterogeneous impacts of extreme climate risks on global energy consumption transition: An international comparative study, Energies, 14, 14, (2021); Global Energy Review 2021, (2021); Statistical Review of World Energy, (2021); Saculsan, Phoebe Grace, Examining risk and return profiles of renewable energy investment in developing countries: the case of the Philippines, Green Finance, 2, 2, pp. 135-150, (2020); Li, Qing, Do government subsidies promote new-energy firms’ innovation?

No consensus has been achieved on the relationship between CSR and firm performance. The objective of this research is to examine how the relationship between CSR and firm performance is contingent on founders’ management roles, especially in the situation of the founder as CEO, which will provide insights into the inconsistent impacts of CSR. Based on panel data analysis, we empirically test the nonlinear relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm performance for China’s Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) listed companies. We further explore how this relationship differs under two types of CEOs: founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs. Our econometric analysis produces two major findings. First, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between CSR and firm performance. Second, the presence of founder CEO weakens the relationship between CSR and firm performance, making the inverted U-shaped curve flatter. This research makes both novel theoretical and practical contributions to entrepreneurship and organization research by providing an enriched understanding of the relationship between CSR and firm performance. It integrates multiple theories to create a framework within which the contingent impacts of CSR can be holistically understood. It also helps managers to realize the nonlinear economic consequences of CSR activities and the different regulatory effects of founder management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Firm Performance; Founder Ceo; Inverted U-shape1; Corporate Social Responsibility; Economic Growth; Firm Size; Market Conditions; Regulatory Framework; China","corporate social responsibility; economic growth; firm size; market conditions; regulatory framework; China","","","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education Youth Fund Project (18YJC630167), the Shaanxi Social Science Fund Project (2017S031), the key project of the Chinese Social Science Foundation (19AGL015).","Wang, Heli C., Corporate social responsibility: An overview and new research directions, Academy of Management Journal, 59, 2, pp. 534-544, (2016); Chen, Roger C.Y., The relationship between ex-ante cost of equity capital and corporate social responsibility in introductory and maturity period, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 2, pp. 1089-1107, (2020); Chen, Ten Suz, Two‐stage production system pondering upon corporate social responsibility in food supply chain: A case study, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 3, pp. 1-19, (2021); Ting, Pihui, Do large firms just talk corporate social responsibility? - The evidence from CSR report disclosure, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Yang, Minghui, Does CSR influence firm performance indicators?

To build sustainability, firms need to have strong social commitment to establish value-creating stakeholder relationships. As boards of directors play a critical role in setting strategy, providing management oversight and monitoring, it is also their responsibility to ensure the firm's commitment to its social responsibilities. With the right composition, boards can be effective in driving long-term vision and creating good stakeholder relationships, contributing to firms' social capital. In this paper, we analyze board characteristics of publicly listed US firms and find evidence that support the diversity theory.

The results demonstrate that the presence of female directors is positively related to firm performance. The percentage of females has a positive relationship with agency cost, which has a negative impact on firm performance. The mediating role of the agency cost variable only reduces the positive impact of gender diversity in the BOD on firm performance, but this relationship is not reversed.

Data are collected from South Africa where integrated reporting and corporate governance practices are mature and listed companies have had more time to implement ESG assurance than in other countries. Research Findings/Insights: Monitoring attributes of boards of directors promotes the use of ESG assurance which provide both limited (moderate) and reasonable (high) assurance. The monitoring attributes of the audit and risk committees limit the use of limited assurance but are associated with the greater use of reasonable assurance. In contrast, internal audit functions are not affecting the use of ESG assurance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides one of the first accounts of how firm-level governance promotes or reduces the use of external assurance in an integrated reporting context. The research also frames ESG assurance as part of the broader corporate governance machinery rather than seeing assurance and governance as separate issues. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Overall, the findings suggest that ESG assurance is an important part of a combined assurance model. As those charged with governance become more proactive in ensuring the credibility of their organizations' corporate reports, they not only choose to appoint an external assuror but also rely on more extensive testing designed to provide higher levels of assurance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assurance; Corporate Governance; Integrated Reporting; Nonfinancial Reporting; Proactivity","","","","Special thanks go to the National Research Foundation for partially funding the cost of this research. 1","Abdel-Khalik, A.

In addition, room price, hotel location, and service quality can also increase customer satisfaction. Web-based customer reviews potentially affect the booking decisions of future tourists, who carefully evaluate reviewers’ comments when making decisions about accommodation. Hotel authorities in Southeast Asian countries can improve hotel service by adopting renewable energy resources, which may in turn increase the booking interest.

As CDM incorporates sustainable development as one of the objectives for the green transition, many countries endeavor to adopt and implement CDM as their cleaner production method. Based on the institutional theory, the study aims to investigate the mechanism by which the institutional process of each ESG pillar makes an opportunity for a host country and to see how such country-specific factors influence the implementation of CDM projects. A county-year unbalanced sample drawn from World Bank and multinational CDM project data was analyzed using panel logistic and Poisson regression. Panel regression results show that high-energy intensity and low renewable electricity output as an environmental pillar positively affect CDM implementation. Unemployment and undernourishment as a social pillar positively affect CDM whereas low government effectiveness and the high rule of law positively affect CDM. In the results of zero-inflated Poisson regression, the direction of government effectiveness was upturned. The findings have broadened and deepened the ESG pillar based on the institutional theory and emphasized sustainable development rather than economic outputs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cdm Implementation; Cdm Projects; Esg; Institutional Theory; Sustainable Development","","","","This work was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund and funded from the project C2220202 of the Green Technology Center of the Republic of Korea.","Abdulrahman, Ahmed Osama, Sustainability improvements in Egypt's oil & gas industry by implementation of flare gas recovery, Journal of Cleaner Production, 98, pp. 116-122, (2015); Aerts, Walter, Intra-industry imitation in corporate environmental reporting: An international perspective, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 25, 3, pp. 299-331, (2006); Aguilera, Ruth, Putting the s back in corporate social responsibility: A multilevel theory of social change in organizations, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 836-863, (2007); 13th International Conference on Clean Energy Icce, (2014); Almer, Christian, Analyzing the effectiveness of international environmental policies: The case of the Kyoto Protocol, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 82, pp. 125-151, (2017); Arminen, Heli, Corruption, climate and the energy-environment-growth nexus, Energy Economics, 80, pp. 621-634, (2019); Econometric Analysis of Panel Data, (2021); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Strategic Explanations for the Early Adoption of ISO 14001, Journal of Business Ethics, 46, 3, pp. 289-299, (2003); Bayer, Patrick, Who uses the Clean Development Mechanism?

It also investigates the moderating role of chief executive officer power (CEOP) in the relationship between the quality of CSR disclosure and firm value (FV) in Chinese listed companies. The evidential research used the up-to-date sample (3, 248) of unbalanced findings for the period of 2014–2020, from the registered Chinese firms in the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges as samples for the study. As a starting point technique, the STATA 15 has been used to test pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on a sample of Chinese listed companies. We use 1-year lagged regression and two SLS regressions to monitor the potential endogeneity problem. The imbalanced data set was received from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) web page, which is the most significant source of information for Chinese publicly listed firms. Data on CSR information items and media reporting are compiled manually. The findings of the study revealed that there are positive FP consequences for the companies engaged in the quality of CSR disclosure. We also report that higher CEO power negatively enhances the quality of CSR disclosure effect on the FP of FV. The research investigates the impact of CSR disclosure and FP by presenting evidence of the moderating role of CEO power. Therefore, it is suggested that a higher law for CSR engagement and disclosure be implemented in China, and robust measures for the implementation of CEO power, although there are financial advantages to be gained. A key relevance to the empirical quality of CSR disclosure research can be recognized as the moderating role of CEO power in the quality of CSR disclosure, FP, and FV in the context of Chinese study. The findings are robust with the use of an instrumental variable method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Theory; Ceo Power; Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure; Financial Performance; Firm Value","","","","","Adomako, Samuel, Chief executive officers' dispositional optimism, host country's rule of law, and foreign market equity mode choice of Ghanaian small and medium-sized enterprises, Thunderbird International Business Review, 63, 1, pp. 63-75, (2021); Journal of Management Research, (2012); Anser, Muhammad Khalid, Moderating effect of innovation on corporate social responsibility and firm performance in realm of sustainable development, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 25, 5, pp. 799-806, (2018); Sustain Account Manage Policy J, (2016); Awaysheh, Amrou, On the relation between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 41, 6, pp. 965-987, (2020); Barnett, Michael L., Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 11, pp. 1101-1122, (2006); Bebchuk, Lucian A., Executive compensation as an agency problem, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 17, 3, pp. 71-92, (2003); Bruynseels, Liesbeth, The audit committee: Management watchdog or personal friend of the CEO?, Accounting Review, 89, 1, pp. 113-145, (2014); Buallay, Amina Mohammed, Corporate social responsibility disclosure and firms' performance in Mediterranean countries: a stakeholders' perspective, EuroMed Journal of Business, 15, 3, pp. 361-375, (2020); Cakici, Nusret, Cross-sectional stock return predictability in China, European Journal of Finance, 23, 7-9, pp. 581-605, (2017)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","16641078","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137716339"

Until recently, scholars have primarily focused on the toll that air pollution exacts through its health effects while ignoring air pollution's impact on consumer behavior. The scattered research in the recent year reveals that air pollution might influence consumers' decision-making process before, during, and after consumptions in both online and offline contexts. However, no research to our knowledge has reviewed the influence effect of air quality on consumer behaviors, which impedes the scholars and practitioners from acquiring knowledge from this emerging field. This informative review aims to collect and analyze the existing scattered research for air pollution effects on consumer decision-making behavior. This review illustrates that the impact of air pollution on consumer behavior is rather extensive, ranging from health risks to emotional changes, from changes in daily habits to individual and group consumption behaviors. We propose that future research can potentially explore the impact of air pollution on consumers' consumption experience and evaluation behavior and examine the differential impacts of air pollution on consumers' individual and group consumption decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Pollution; Consumer Decision Making; Environmental Psychology; Literature Review; Stimulus-organism-response Framework","","","","The authors acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Project 71571029, 71872027].

We reach two interesting conclusions. First, consistent with the view that the social capital of a region can constrain managerial opportunistic behavior, enhance the flow of information, and mitigate moral hazard and agency concerns, we find that banks from countries with higher social capital operate with lower cost of equity. Second, consistent with the view of a substitutional relationship between formal and informal institutions we find that the association of social capital with the cost of bank equity becomes weaker in countries with strong formal institutions. The results hold while controlling for numerous bank-level and country-level characteristics, as well as when we account for endogeneity with the use of an instrumental variables approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Problems; Banks; Cost Of Equity; Social Capital; Trust","","","","We would like to thank Carol Alexander (Handling Co-Editor), an Associate Editor, and two anonymous reviewers for various comments that helped us improve an earlier version of the manuscript We also thank Mohammed Belkhir and Rwan AlKhatib for their valuable comments.

ERC is a robust estimation in the absence of reasonable expectations about future returns. Design/methodology/approach: The portfolio consists of five environmental-friendly exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It applies equal risk optimization, beneficial when the assets are firmly linked, such as the ETFs. This paper operationalizes 20 covariance models in portfolio construction, and a portfolio with classic covariance is the benchmark to beat. To select the best-fitting model(s), the paper applies statistical inferences of the model confidence set. This research also constructs the newly-developed minimum connectedness optimization method and utilizes maximum drawdown as the primary evaluation tool. Findings: The outbreak of COVID-19 hugely impacts the portfolio drawdown. The results also show that the classic covariance is hard to beat, partly explained by estimation error and model misspecification. This paper suggests that equal risk contribution can benefit from copula-based covariance. It consistently and significantly outperforms the other models in various robustness tests. Practical implications: In the absence of substantial predictions about future returns and the existence of strongly linked assets, selecting appropriate portfolio components by risk contribution is a sound choice. Originality/value: This is the first paper to select the best-fitting model(s) of ERC portfolio during the COVID-19. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drawdown; Equal Risk Contribution; Model Confidence Set","","","","The author would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

We analyze the nine-year panel data of China’s Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)-listed companies to empirically study the relationship between founder CEO (vs. non-founder CEO), CEO characteristics, and firm innovation efficiency. Our analysis produces four major findings. First, founder CEO firms have a lower innovation input and higher innovation output than non-founder CEO firms. Second, compared with male founder CEOs, female founder CEOs can further reduce innovation input without sacrificing innovation output. Third, founder CEOs with a higher education level can also further reduce innovation input without sacrificing innovation output. Finally, compared with founder CEOs that are not the chairman of the board, the founder CEOs that take dual positions (CEO and chairman) allocate higher innovation input, but the innovation output does not increase.

Our empirical findings corroborate the presence of a negative tail effect of wage gap on productivity and employee morale. While worsening employee turnover and productivity, and increasing the chances of workplace controversies, high salary gap is found to be associated with a more efficient cost structure and higher profitability. Our evidence suggests that extreme salary gap may be curbed by targeted internal policies favoring internal promotion and career development, unionization, employee and managerial training. The composition of the board’s remuneration committee appears to play but a minor role in shaping the scale of salary gap. The results of the study are in line with equity aversion theory and suggest that extreme wage inequality may impede firms’ growth with spillover effects observable at the macro-level. Targeted policies may be necessary to counter the negative repercussions of high compensation disparities as within-firm mechanisms appear insufficient to mitigate them. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Executive Remuneration; Governance; Productivity; Salary Gap; Financial System; Governance Approach; Productivity; Wage Gap","financial system; governance approach; productivity; wage gap","","","","Casey-Campbell, Milly, Sticking it all together: A critical assessment of the group cohesion-performance literature, International Journal of Management Reviews, 11, 2, pp. 223-246, (2009); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1992); Lemieux, Thomas, Performance pay and wage inequality, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 124, 1, pp. 1-49, (2009); Journal of Political Economy, (1981); Pay Without Performance the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation, (2004); Nature, (2005); Fehr, Ernst, A theory of fairness, competition, and cooperation, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114, 3, pp. 817-868, (1999); Bebchuk, Lucian A., The costs of entrenched boards, Journal of Financial Economics, 78, 2, pp. 409-433, (2005); Oyer, Paul, Why do firms use incentives that have no incentive effects?, Journal of Finance, 59, 4, pp. 1619-1650, (2004); Core, John E., Corporate governance, chief executive officer compensation, and firm performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 51, 3, pp. 371-406, (1999)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133512459"

Many studies have analyzed the expanding literature on environmental, social and governance (ESG) from various perspectives, but only a handful of this work directly informs the decision-making of practitioners like institutional investors. We address the mismatch by conducting a review of the literature that can benefit both academia and industry. Before commencing the review, we consulted experts in the industry by contacting institutional investors from Australia and Japan with Asset Under Management of as much as US$500 billion, along with others in the finance industry. These practitioners voiced limited interest in understanding the motivations of ESG-conscious investors, an area that many academic studies have examined. The most common of the practitioners' requests relates to how portfolios that are financially viable can be constructed to incorporate investors' ESG-related preferences. We conduct a systematic literature that is based on this feedback and find that, even in an ESG-themed investment vehicle, the investor's individual ESG preferences may not align well with the fund's objective and degree of conviction. We discuss the resulting challenges and opportunities investors face when integrating ESG into their investment practices, thus providing a guide for investors who wish to re-think their ESG strategies and beliefs. Finally, the paper draws attention to alternative ESG data and the need for studies on dynamic materiality-mapping. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Governance; Esg; Literature Review; Portfolio Management; Sri; Decision Making; Financial Data Processing; Corporate Governance; Corporates; Environmental, Social And Governance; Financial Institution; Institutional Investors; Literature Reviews; Portfolio Managements; Sri; United Nations; Zero Emission; Investments","Decision making; Financial data processing; Corporate governance; Corporates; Environmental, social and governance; Financial institution; Institutional investors; Literature reviews; Portfolio managements; SRI; United Nations; Zero emission; Investments","","","Funding text 1: We thank Yusuke Aramaki (Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking), Lorenzo Ciapetti (Deloitte), David Forrest (Pinnacle Investment Management), Elias Greil (Alantra), Lachlan Hughes (Swell Asset Management), Kenichi Kanegae (Asset Management One), Rhyan Nash (QIC), Scott Pappas (Cbus Super), Lisa Rawlings (Suncorp), Pieter Stoltz (Eley-Griffiths), Yusuke Suzuki (Janus Henderson), Kulunu Vithanage (BDO), Stephen Walsh (8iP), Osei Wiafe (Q-Super), Artem Zainitdinov (Elston Asset Management), and other practitioners for valuable insights and suggestions.

However, there remain several important research design considerations that must be accounted for over the process of planning, executing, and writing event studies. Because of this, many issues and sources of uncertainty emerge among students and early researchers. There is a need for a comprehensive guide to these common issues and how to address them, delving into the nuances and steps to take. Applied Guide for Event Study Research in Supply Chain Management supports graduate students and researchers to understand how to develop, execute, and publish event studies, specifically in the area of supply chain management, with valuable support for wider management studies. This book anticipates many reviewer and editorial concerns and questions and explores how to design a study that addresses issues before they arise, or how to tackle the issue during the review process.

In light of the recent global financial crisis, banking risk management has become a significant concern of banking regulators and government agencies. This work aims to build a model for assessing banking risks. The primary study method is economic–mathematical modeling based on the standardized model of the Basel Committee for Operational Risk Management, the modified CAPM model, and the model developed by Shapiro and Cornell for currency risk management. The information base was the financial statements of Bank Credit Agricole (Poland). As a result, an economic–mathematical model is built, which is the optimal combination of operational, currency, and credit risk management models. This model calculates the optimal values of bank balance sheet items, which allows for making the right management decisions. It allowed adjusting the value of the bank profit by 3.6 million US dollars.

In the past, research regarding corporate governance and financial variables focused solely on performance variables such as Tobin's Q and ROA. This assessment completely ignores that corporate governance principles have a broader implication on financial variables than only performance. Purpose: Our research aimed to determine whether companies with good corporate governance practices were more resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by the deterioration of various financial variables. Research methodology: To achieve the aim, in the empirical part of the article, information on companies' corporate governance and financial variables was collected, and based on them, correlation, regression and scatter plot analyses were conducted. Results: Our correlation, regression, and scatter plot analyses revealed that on both group and individual company levels, companies with higher levels of corporate governance would have their financial variables deteriorate significantly more compared to companies with low levels of compliance. Novelty: This is the first publication on the given topic.

The paper is a case study of Pershing Square Holdings Ltd., St. Peter Port, UK (PSH), which launched SPAC IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd., New York, NY, USA (PSTH), which succeeded in raising the largest capital from influential investors in 2020. Social capital theory is employed to provide theoretical structure for the analysis. Using annual reports, publicly available information on the internet, as well as social media platforms related to the company and its strategy, the authors critically analyse and highlight how the Tontine’s founder and his team utilized their structural, relational, and cognitive social capital to attract investors and gained recognition as the most successful SPAC IPO in the market in 2020. The authors found the ability to structure a SPAC IPO that departs from a typical SPAC, and the choice of timing to enter the SPAC market resulted in an over subscription and higher market valuation ratings of its IPO, as well as allowed the sponsor to be selective of its investors. This is the first study to address the significance of social capital at the individual and organizational level in creating value for SPAC IPOs. Potential investors can gain understanding and insights on the mechanics of SPAC IPOs and the importance of the founder’s social capital in ensuring successful investment. Successful SPAC IPOs will create interest in the marketplace and enhance the value of investment for investors and helped private companies to get listed faster. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blank Check Companies; Human Intellectual Capital; Social Capital; Spacs; Value Creation","","","","","Financial Times, (2020); undefined, (2021); Beattie, Vivien A., Value creation and business models: Refocusing the intellectual capital debate, British Accounting Review, 45, 4, pp. 243-254, (2013); Beatty, Randolph P., Impact of the penny stock reform act of 1990 on the initial public offering market, Journal of Law and Economics, 46, 2, pp. 517-541, (2003); Blankespoor, Elizabeth, A Hard Look at SPAC Projections, Management Science, 68, 6, pp. 4742-4753, (2022); Boubaker, Sabri, Management earnings forecasts and IPO performance: evidence of a regime change, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 48, 4, pp. 1083-1121, (2017); Management International, (2020); Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, (1986); Brogi, Marina, Can governance help in making an IPO “successful”?

The algorithm, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and neural network are single models as alternative sources of diversity information. Previous research has shown that ensembles are more accurate than single models. Single model and modified ensemble bagging model are some of the techniques we will study in this paper. We experimented with the banking industry’s financial ratios. The results of his observations are: First, an ensemble is always more accurate than a single model. Second, we observe that modified ensemble bagging models show improved classification model performance on balanced datasets, as they can adjust behavior and make them more suitable for relatively small datasets. The accuracy rate is 97% in the bagging ensemble learning model, an increase in the accuracy level of up to 16% compared to other models that use unbalanced datasets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bagging; Bankruptcy; Class Imbalance; Classification; Ensemble","","","","Many thanks to Prof. Dr. Nanna Suryana Herman and LPPM who has guided in this research and LPPM Ma?soem University who provided support.","Mehreen, Mehreen, Proposing a multidimensional bankruptcy prediction model: An approach for sustainable Islamic banking, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 8, (2020); International Journal of Business and Management, (2018); Nurfalah, Irfan, Early warning to banking crises in the dual financial system in Indonesia: The Markov switching approach, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics, 31, 2, pp. 133-156, (2018); Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); Mousavi, Mohammad Mahdi, Performance evaluation of bankruptcy prediction models: An orientation-free super-efficiency DEA-based framework, International Review of Financial Analysis, 42, pp. 64-75, (2015); Laila, Nisful, Financial distress prediction using Bankometer model on Islamic and conventional banks: Evidence from Indonesia, International Journal of Economics and Management, 11, SpecialIssue1, pp. 169-181, (2017); Altman, Edward I., Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z- Score and ZETA® models, pp. 428-455, (2013); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2017); Shrivastava, Arvind, Business distress prediction using bayesian logistic model for Indian firms, Risks, 6, 4, (2018); Altman, Edward I., Financial Distress Prediction in an International Context: A Review and Empirical Analysis of Altman's Z-Score Model, Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 28, 2, pp. 131-171, (2017)","","Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science","","","","","","22528938; 20894872","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129093918"

Furthermore, the study investigates the relation among qualitative disclosures, patent statistics and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: All manufacturing companies of CNX 500 Index of National Stock Exchange of India Limited are considered. Based on data availability, 243 manufacturing firms spanning across seven major manufacturing sectors are included. Secondary data were obtained from the annual report of companies and patent databases from 2004 to 2005 to 2013–2014, generating a sample of 2,430 firm years. Content analysis and citation analysis are used for collecting the relevant data. Findings: Overall, the study results indicated increasing trends for all types of intellectual capital disclosures. Similar trends are observed for patent applications and patent grants, indicating a surge in patenting activities across the manufacturing sector. However, increasing trends in patenting activities are not reflected for forward and backward citations. In addition, significant differences in means and trend coefficients for qualitative disclosures and patent statistics indicated industry specificity within the Indian manufacturing sector. Furthermore, industry specificity is observed when translating intellectual capital to firm performance. The measure of firm performance, that is, Tobin's Q, is having a significant positive association with qualitative disclosures and patent statistics. Research limitations/implications: As the study is based on secondary data, its accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the data sources such as the annual reports of companies and patent databases. Practical implications: The study findings imply that policymakers should devise and execute sector-specific policy interventions. Moreover, managers and policymakers should emphasize the qualitative aspect of patenting activities. Originality/value: The study is an original work that highlights the trends in qualitative disclosures in the Indian manufacturing context. The value relevance of intellectual capital and patent statistics has been established. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Firm Performance; Intellectual Capital Disclosures; Patent Applications; Patent Citations; Patent Grant","","","","The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding of this research by National Science and Technology Management Information System (NSTMIS), Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.","Abdolmohammadi, Mohammad J., Intellectual capital disclosure and market capitalization, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 6, 3, pp. 397-416, (2005); Abeysekera, Indra, Intellectual capital reporting between a developing and developed nation, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 8, 2, pp. 329-345, (2007); Abeysekera, Indra, The relation of intellectual capital disclosure strategies and market value in two political settings, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 12, 2, pp. 319-338, (2011); Abeysekera, Indra, An empirical investigation of annual reporting trends of intellectual capital in Sri Lanka, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 16, 3, pp. 151-163, (2005); Alfraih, Mishari M., The value relevance of intellectual capital disclosure: empirical evidence from Kuwait, Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance, 25, 1, pp. 22-38, (2017); Andreeva, Tatiana E., Do all elements of intellectual capital matter for organizational performance?

Design/methodology/approach: This study systematically reviews the financial performance measures of supply chains. More specifically, this research reviews a total of 100 papers published in more than 50 peer-reviewed journals. The reviewed papers are categorized into three major areas of engineering, business and management. Additionally, the papers are investigated based on country, journal frequency, applied methods, publication date and research type (application or developmental). Findings: According to the obtained results, cost, return on assets (ROA), sales, asset turnover, return on investment (ROI), market share, inventory turnover, profit margin, revenue growth, economic value added (EVA) and cash-to-cash cycle are the most common metrics of financial performance measurement. Next, a framework is developed based on different categories of performance measurement and decision levels of the supply chain. Finally, some research directions are suggested to be further investigated by other scholars. Originality/value: Although available studies on supply chain performance measurement are very vast and comprehensive, the majority of the studies have neglected to highlight the importance of financial measures. In other words, with the advent of nonfinancial measures, however, the majority of supply chain managers still prefer to consider financial issues in their performance assessment process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Performance Measurement; Performance Metrics; Review; Supply Chain","","","","The authors would like to appreciate the constructive comments of anonymous reviewers which really improved the quality, communication and presentation of the paper.No conflict of interest is reported by the authors.","Supply Chain Maturity and Financial Performance Study of Swedish Smes, (2009); Agarwal, Vineet, Comparing the performance of market-based and accounting-based bankruptcy prediction models, Journal of Banking and Finance, 32, 8, pp. 1541-1551, (2008); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2016); Ahmad, Kamilah, The deployment of performance measurement system under the supply chain management environment: The case of Malaysian manufacturing companies, Management and Production Engineering Review, 9, 1, pp. 3-12, (2018); Fantazy, Kamel Aissa, An empirical study of the relationships among strategy, flexibility, and performance in the supply chain context, Supply Chain Management, 14, 3, pp. 177-188, (2009); In 23rd Annual Nofoma Conference, (2011); Almasi, Maryam, Sustainable Supplier Selection and Order Allocation under Risk and Inflation Condition, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 68, 3, pp. 823-837, (2021); Altman, Edward I., Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z- Score and ZETA® models, pp. 428-455, (2013); Aramyan, Lusiné Henrik, Performance measurement in agri-food supply chains: A case study, Supply Chain Management, 12, 4, pp. 304-315, (2007); Arif-Uz-Zaman, Kazi, Lean supply chain performance measurement, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 63, 5, pp. 588-612, (2014)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","17410401","","","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100835975"

Importantly, financial integration ensures the sustainable growth of microfinance institutions through the provision of more financial resources, if needed. To identify these drivers, we used a panel dataset of 953 microfinance institutions (MFIs) from the MIX market dataset and country-level data from the World Bank for the 2003–2016 period. We applied a panel quantile approach with nonadditive fixed effects. Our results reveal that an increase in financial development slows the financial integration of MFIs. However, considering the transitory aspect of financial integration by each quantile, it appears that financial development positively impacts the financial integration of MFIs. The impact of financial development increases as the financial integration level increases. Similar results show a positive link between agency costs and financial integration. More financial interconnections with commercial banks justify the appearance of high agency costs due to an increased interest of commercial banks. There is a significant and negative link between the profitability of MFIs and their financial integration. Moreover, the results reveal that financial integration is a significant determinant of mission drift occurrence in client portfolios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Costs; Financial Development; Financial Integration; Financial Performance And Outreach; G21; G24; G32; Microfinance; O50","","","","","Ahlin, Christian R., Where does microfinance flourish?

On the journal’s 15th anniversary (2007 to 2021), this study venerated the journal by providing a detailed retrospective analysis of its output using variate bibliometric tools. Performance analysis revealed a diminishing number of annual publications and growing citations in IJF, illustrating its increasing standards and growing reputation. Bibliographic coupling, content analysis, and thematic review provided the details of various themes that have evolved in the Indian Journal of Finance. The major themes that emerged from papers published in the IJF over the study duration cover: financial inclusion and financial literacy, social and environmental disclosure, stock market efficiency, investor behavior and financial wellbeing, financial crises, corporate governance, volatility, the spillover effect, and capital structure and dividend policy decisions. The journal’s keyword analysis and temporal evolution veraciously showed the recent publication trends and focus of the Indian Journal of Finance. The study discovered the focal areas where most of the papers are published to address contemporary behavioral finance and empirical finance issues covering deep-impact research on the diverse research composition of IJF. We believe that the structural summarization of the published articles will significantly help practitioners espouse corporates’ financial strategies and decisions.

It was conducted with data from the 44 companies registered in the financial sector on Bursa, Saudi Arabia, from 2015 to 2019, eventually totalling 195 firm-year observations. The results indicate that the BC's tenure and expertise are positively associated with the financial firm's performance. The attribute of multiple directorships held by the BC, on the other hand, has no relationship with corporate performance. The results help policy makers better understand BC characteristics, which can be incorporated into future policy to ensure the protection of shareholder investment and the interests of various stakeholders. The results may also be useful to legislators seeking to improve BC efficiency, overall corporate governance and investor confidence in the organization. To the researcher's knowledge, the relationship between CP and BC characteristics has not been investigated, even although the chairman is in charge of appointing directors who could expand the company and make contributions not only to the board but also to CP (Owen & Kirchmaier, 2008).

Poor hospital financial health can precipitate closure, limiting patients' access to care. Whether hospital quality is associated with financial health remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare financial performance at high-quality and low-quality hospitals. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of U.S. hospitals using the American Hospital Association and Hospital Compare datasets for years 2013 to 2018. We used multilevel mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models with fixed year effects and random intercepts for hospitals to identify associations between hospitals' measured quality outcomes-30-day hospital-wide readmission rate and the patient safety indicator-90 (PSI- 90)-and their financial margins and risk of financial distress in the same year and the subsequent year. Our sample included 20,919 observations from 4,331 unique hospitals. Results In 2018, the median 30-day readmission rate was 15.2 (interquartile range [IQR] 14.8- 15.6), the median PSI-90 score was 0.96 (IQR 0.89-1.07), the median operating margin was -1.8 (IQR -9.7-5.9), and 750 (22.7%) hospitals experienced financial distress. Hospitals in the best quintile of readmission rates experienced higher operating margins (+0.95%, 95% CI [0.51-1.39], p < .001) and lower odds of distress (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% CI [0.45-0.70], p < .001) in the same year as compared to hospitals in the worst quintile. Hospitals in the best quintile of PSI-90 had higher operating margins (+0.62%, 95% CI [0.17- 1.08], p = .007) and lower odds of financial distress (OR 0.70, 95% CI [0.55-0.89], p = .003) as compared to hospitals in the worst quintile. The results were qualitatively similar for the same-year and lag-year analyses.

The assessment applies to the period, 2019–2026, with the use of the data on the financial indicators for 2015–2020. Five novel structural time-series models, which have the indicators derived from Altman’s EM Z”-score model as predictors, were used, and a new conceptual framework for assessing bankruptcy risk is provided. The framework expands the applicability of credit-risk-scoring models to multiyear predictions, and it takes into account the dynamism of the transitions of the firms among Altman’s risk zones. The predictions that were obtained when the Springate and Zmi-jewski scores were applied along with the Altman Z”-scores demonstrate the fair applicability of the scores for the models that are introduced here. The results of the models were confirmed by 270 artificial neural networks and they were compared to the results of the classical time-series models. The crisis started to have a negative effect on bankruptcy risk in 2020, and this effect is expected to rise until 2023; currently, in 2022, the highest number of hotel companies may be headed for bank-ruptcy. Amelioration in the position of the companies cannot be expected before 2024; however, even in 2026, the risk of bankruptcy will remain high when compared to the pre-COVID-19 period and, thus, the surviving companies will become more fragile to any further exogenous changes. These results provide a basis for the adaption of state-supported measures and business policies in order to withstand the crisis and to ensure sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Altman’s Z-score Models; Bankruptcy Risk; Covid-19; Financial Sustainability; Hotel Industry; Tourism Crisis; Bankruptcy; Conceptual Framework; Covid-19; Environmental Impact Assessment; Financial System; Hotel Industry; Numerical Model; Sustainability; Tourism; Serbia","bankruptcy; conceptual framework; COVID-19; environmental impact assessment; financial system; hotel industry; numerical model; sustainability; tourism; Serbia","","","","Srebro, Bosiljka, Bankruptcy risk prediction in ensuring the sustainable operation of agriculture companies, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 14, (2021); Henley Manager Update, (2005); From Crisis to Success, (2003); Corporate Financial Distress and Bankruptcy, (1993); Tourism Crises Causes Consequences and Management, (2007); International Journal of Business and Management, (2010); Jovanović, Dejan, Financial indicators as predictors of illiquidity, Romanian Journal of Economic Forecasting, 20, 1, pp. 128-149, (2017); Pegg, Shane A., The impact of seasonality on tourism and hospitality operations in the alpine region of New South Wales, Australia, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 31, 3, pp. 659-666, (2012); Calisto, Maria de Lurdes, Environmental sustainability strategies for smaller companies in the hotel industry: Doing the right thing or doing things right?, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 18, (2021); Review of Agricultural Food and Environmental Studies, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128787836"

The results of our research show that female CEOs have a significant negative effect on financing policy. This has a significant positive effect on firm performance, but no significant effect on investing policy. We also found that CEO education negatively and significantly affects financing policy, but positively and significantly affects investing policy and performance. Meanwhile, CEO age has a significant negative influence on financing policy but no significant influence on investing policy and performance. Our research results support behavioral finance theory by providing empirical evidence that CEO behavioral aspects are correlated with the female gender, education, and age in terms of significantly affecting firm policies and performance.

This study aims to investigate consumer risk perceptions of FBD, considering different consequences and scenarios. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 150 consumers from ten restaurants in Brazil. Consumers were interviewed in the restaurant post-food consumption to determine the personal risk of experiencing FBD. The restaurant food safety measures was assessed using a validated checklist. A FBD risk score was calculated. Ten questions were used to assess consumers' risk perceptions. The likelihood perception (L) of FBD was measured according to three contexts: actual restaurant of food consumption, another restaurant, and the consumers’ home. The consequences (C) of FBD on consumers' lifestyle were measured considering the impact on financial, performance, social, physical, psychological, and time aspects. Thus, 21 measures of cumulative risk perception (3L x 7C) were established. Findings indicated that consumers perceived the likelihood of FBD as low, mainly when considering food consumed at the actual restaurant and home. It is noted that risk perception was determined as higher when considering performance, physical, and time consequences. There was no association between the risk assessment determined for the restaurant and consumer risk perceptions from such restaurants. Consumers were skeptical about their personal likelihood of experiencing FBD, unaware of the actual risk associated with FDB. However, consumers consider that the impact of FBD on their performance, physical, and time is relevant. In a multidimensional way the risk assessment could be helpful to understand consumer behavior relating to food and restaurant choices. Understanding consumer fears and perceptions generate invaluable insight and data that can be used to develop targeted educational campaigns and food safety strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer; Food Away From Home; Foodservice; Restaurant; Risk Perception","","","","This study was supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation ( FAPESP ) grant #2019/10936–0.

More precisely, it examines whether and how the country’s legal system and the level of investor protection interact with the firm-level corporate governance and affect firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the “G-Index” governance score developed by the Governance Metrics International rating for a sample of 12,728 firm-year observations from 23 countries over the 2009–2016 period. Findings: The results show that the interaction between the country-level institutions and corporate governance system significantly affect the firm performance. In particular, the findings indicate that firms operating in common law countries tend to exhibit a positive valuation effect and higher performance than firms with a comparable corporate governance level operating in civil law countries. More precisely, the authors find that in common law countries, higher investor protection with enhanced corporate governance is associated with better firm performance. However, firms operating in civil law countries with weaker investor protection and a comparable corporate governance level tend to experience a negative valuation effect. Originality/value: The findings suggest that the institutional and legal environment is crucial and important in determining the value-maximizing level of good governance practices. Managers and regulators should carefully analyze the cost of these initiatives and should coordinate it with the needs of the country’s legal system. The challenge for the company will be how to adjust its corporate governance strategy according to the needs and demands of the country’s legal system in which the company operates to improve its performance. The regulators should ensure a fit between the specifics of the national legal and institutional environment and corporate governance standards and practices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Civil Law Country; Common Law Country; Corporate Governance; Firm Performance; Legal Environment; Legal Protection Of Investors","","","","","Aggarwal, Reena, Differences in governance practices between U.S. and foreign firms: Measurement, causes, and consequences, Review of Financial Studies, 22, 8, pp. 3131-3169, (2009); Alahdal, Waleed M., The impact of corporate governance on financial performance of Indian and GCC listed firms: An empirical investigation, Research in International Business and Finance, 51, (2020); Berger, Allen N., Corporate Capital Structure and Firm Value: International Evidence on the Special Roles of Bank Debt, Review of Corporate Finance, 1, 1-2, (2021); Ammann, Manuel, Corporate governance and firm value: International evidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 18, 1, pp. 36-55, (2011); Anderson, Anne M., A cross-country comparison of corporate governance and firm performance: Do financial structure and the legal system matter?, Journal of Contemporary Accounting and Economics, 5, 2, pp. 61-79, (2009); Anderson, Anne M., Corporate Governance: Does One Size Fit All?, Journal of Corporate Accounting and Finance, 24, 3, pp. 51-64, (2013); Firm Level Corporate Governance in Emerging Markets A Case Study of India, (2008); Ball, Ray, The effect of international institutional factors on properties of accounting earnings, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 29, 1, pp. 1-51, (2000); Bayer, Christian, Corporate governance and incentive contracts: Historical evidence from a legal reform, Explorations in Economic History, 46, 4, pp. 464-481, (2009); Bebchuk, Lucian A., The costs of entrenched boards, Journal of Financial Economics, 78, 2, pp. 409-433, (2005)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","10867376","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122691330"

Design/methodology/approach: The authors have created a corporate governance index for India using 15 of the variables used in past research. Hierarchical regression has been used in the study to control for possible inter-firm correlation in governance scores. Findings: Using principal component analysis, the authors derive five factors for the corporate governance index – board composition, shareholder responsibility, ownership, responsible board behavior and fair executive compensation. Using the random intercept mixed-effects model, the authors find that corporate governance behaviors of firms affiliated to business groups are more similar within business groups than within industries. Practical implications: Regulatory authorities generally target individual firms to enforce good corporate governance practices. As companies affiliated with the same business group exhibit similar governance practices, regulators can also set norms for business groups in addition to individual firms. Originality/value: Scant research has studied the corporate governance behavior of firms affiliated with business groups. By making business groups (and industries) the unit of analysis, the authors have studied the corporate governance behavior of firms as a cluster in the context of an emerging country, India. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clsa Governance Index; Components Of Corporate Governance; Corporate Governance In India; Indian Business Groups; Mixed-effects Model","","","","The authors grateful to the participants at the World Finance and Banking Symposium, held in Bangkok, December 14-15, 2017 for their helpful feedback.

We apply eight variables, including the put/call ratio, the EUR/USD exchange rate, the volatility index, the Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB), the short-term trading index, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, inflation, and the interest rate. The GRA model results showed that the NYSE, CRB, EUR/USD, and PCR were the four main variables influencing consumer ETFs. The GRA test results of all the ANN models' data showed that the back propagation neural network (BPN) was the best predictive model. Based on the classification of different percentages of training data, the results of GRA revealed that the radial basis function neural network and the time-delay recurrent neural network exhibited consistent results, compared to BPN and the recurrent neural network. The results also pointed out that different percentages of training data were suitable for predicting consumer ETFs' performance based on high and low grey relationship grade variables. Evidence has shown that the ETFs in Brazil and China are more predictable than those in other countries. All ANN models' results indicated that the use of 10% testing data could predict consumer ETFs better, particularly the ETFs of the United States (US) and those excluding the United States (EX-US). The Diebold–Mariano (DM) test results suggest that the best predictability model for consumer ETFs is BPN, which is significantly superior to other models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Consumer Exchange-traded Funds; Grey Relational Analysis; Artificial Neural Network; Consumption Behavior; Exchange Rate; Investment; Numerical Model; Stock Market; New York [united States]; United States","artificial neural network; consumption behavior; exchange rate; investment; numerical model; stock market; New York [United States]; United States","","","","Acharya, Ram N., Examining the CRB index as a leading indicator for US inflation, Applied Economics Letters, 17, 15, pp. 1493-1496, (2010); Alexander, Carol O., Hedging index exchange traded funds, Journal of Banking and Finance, 32, 2, pp. 326-337, (2008); Andreou, Andreas S., Exchange-Rates Forecasting: A Hybrid Algorithm Based on Genetically Optimized Adaptive Neural Networks, Computational Economics, 20, 3, pp. 191-210, (2002); Armano, Giuliano, A hybrid genetic-neural architecture for stock indexes forecasting, Information Sciences, 170, 1, pp. 3-33, (2005); Arora, Vipin, The divergence between core and headline inflation: Implications for consumers' inflation expectations, Journal of Macroeconomics, 38, PB, pp. 497-504, (2013); Azadeh, Ali H., Annual electricity consumption forecasting by neural network in high energy consuming industrial sectors, Energy Conversion and Management, 49, 8, pp. 2272-2278, (2008); J Bus Econ Res, (2008); Bekiros, Stelios D., Direction-of-change forecasting using a volatility-based recurrent neural network, Journal of Forecasting, 27, 5, pp. 407-417, (2008); Boehmer, Beatrice, Trading your neighbor's ETFs: Competition or fragmentation?, Journal of Banking and Finance, 27, 9, pp. 1667-1703, (2003); Journal of Mathematical Finance, (2013)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14358921; 03777332","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103274079"

It additionally investigates the impact of cash holdings on the FP. We used data for 106 banks across 13 countries in the MENA region for eight years, from 2010 to 2017. The empirical findings reveal that CH has a negative association with board independence as well gender diversity. While, our findings reveal a positive relationship with board size as well as CEO duality, but no linkage to board meetings. Our result shows an insignificant association between board effectiveness and FP. Finally, an empirical study indicates there is no relationship between cash holdings and FP. This study is constrained by including only IBs with neglected other IFIs. We also measure FP by existing accounting measures with neglected economics and future FP measures. We just focus on BOD characteristics, while the future investigation may include CG of SSB. The findings have implications for stockholders, regulators and policyholders by determining which BE features can support decisions for holding cash to maximize stakeholders’ wealth. This study adds value for how board effectiveness can be treated as a mediator in determining the level of CH and FP for financial institutions as banks across the MENA region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Effectiveness; Cash Holdings; Financial Performance And Mena Countries","","","","","Abdul Gafoor, C.

The firms’ value is found to positively correlate with total assets and profits for companies in which their stocks are characterised by overreaction but have no correlation to book value. Financial institutions and stocks in the wholesale industry demonstrated remarkable overreactions. However, the automotive, building and construction, food and beverage, and cement industry show evidence of higher underreaction.

The book also looks at the future evolution of the normative framework post MiFID2 addressing in detail two key trends that are already affecting the way in which risk tolerance is dealt with in European financial markets – sustainable development and fintech and roboadvisory.

Sensitivity confirmation is not based on the data describing economic downturn but on permanent internal industry factors. Internal factors take into consideration cost dependency on changes in output quantity produced. Ex ante analysis would discover why some industries would be more vulnerable than the others when significant economic disruption occurs. It has a serious impact on industry performance and business competitiveness position. The examined sensitivity will be expressed by the indicator degree of operating leverage (DOL). The verified assumption should classify neutral industries as sectors with low sensitivity and cyclical branches as industries with high sensitivity. The research is based on the data of more than 1,000 enterprises belonging to four industry sectors. Cyclical industries are represented by CZ-NACE 29 Manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers and CZ-NACE H Transportation and Storage. Neutral sectors are symbolized by CZ-NACE 10 Manufacture of food products, CZ-NACE 20 Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products. Research conclusions are not demonstrable because initial assumptions were not confirmed and significant differences between cyclical and neutral industry branches were not unexpectedly detected using DOL.

To this end, a research model was developed according to the Natural Resource Based View Theory and the Upper Echelon Theory. Methodology: A survey was conducted of 116 listed Italian companies with at least one female director holding a specified role. A moderated hierarchical regression was employed to test the research hypotheses. Findings: Environmental sustainability orientation positively influences green exploitation innovation and exploration innovation. Moreover, the roles of women on corporate boards strengthen the effect of environmental sustainability orientation on green innovation ambidexterity. Research limits: The size of the sample and its nature required prudence in generalizing the results to unlisted Italian companies. Practical implications: Environmental sustainability orientation is an affordable solution to address the innovation paradox, since it contributes to a balance between exploitation and exploration activities. Moreover, a higher number of female directors should be present on the boards of firms that look to improve environmental sustainability by fostering green innovation ambidexterity. Originality of the paper: Environmental sustainability orientation, green innovation ambidexterity, and women on corporate boards were contextually investigated for the first time. Thus, the study adds a more granular understanding of these constructs through a model that is theoretically derived and empirically examined. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Orientation Sustainability; Exploitation Innovation; Exploration Innovation; Green Innovation Ambidexterity; Women On Corporate Boards","","","","","Aboelmaged, Mohamed Gamal Shehata, Absorptive capacity and green innovation adoption in SMEs: The mediating effects of sustainable organisational capabilities, Journal of Cleaner Production, 220, pp. 853-863, (2019); Adams, Renée B., Beyond the glass ceiling: Does gender matter?, Management Science, 58, 2, pp. 219-235, (2012); Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); European Management Journal, (2022); Akhtar, Pervaiz, Dynamic capabilities and environmental sustainability for emerging economies’ multinational enterprises, International Studies of Management and Organization, 50, 1, pp. 27-42, (2020); Aktin, Tülin, Mathematical modelling of sustainable procurement strategies: Three case studies, Journal of Cleaner Production, 113, pp. 767-780, (2016); Albertini, Elisabeth, What are the environmental capabilities, as components of the sustainable intellectual capital, that matter to the CEOs of European companies?, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 22, 5, pp. 918-937, (2021); Albort-Morant, Gema, Mapping the field: A bibliometric analysis of green innovation, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 6, (2017); Amorelli, María Florencia, Trends in the dynamic evolution of board gender diversity and corporate social responsibility, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 28, 2, pp. 537-554, (2021); Amran, Azlan Bin, The influence of governance structure and strategic corporate social responsibility toward sustainability reporting quality, Business Strategy and the Environment, 23, 4, pp. 217-235, (2014)","","Fondazione Cueim","","","","","","03935108","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140298680"

More specifically, all mergers of listed companies during the period 2012–2016 are examined, with the analysis of a final sample of twenty-six companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. The evaluation of the accounting statements and the performance of Greek listed companies is done by extracting and comparing various figures from them (financial ratios) before and after the implementation of mergers. This research is based on the methodology of Healy, Palepu, and Ruback (1992) and Ramaswamy and Waegelein (2003) in order to explore if there is a positive or negative result from the merger transaction. The research results did not show any statistically significant change in any of the research financial ratios after the mergers. However, the effect of the absorbing company’s industry was examined in relation to the analyzed financial ratios and no better performance was observed for those in any industry. Finally, mergers as a competitiveness strategy in the business arena managed to provide the involved companies with a stable accounting performance during the crisis period in Greece. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Measures; Accounting Performance; Competitiveness Strategy; Financial Ratios; Greece; Mergers","","","","","International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, (2017); Southeuropean Review of Business Finance and Accounting, (2012); Alhenawi, Yasser, Long-term impact of merger synergies on performance and value, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 58, pp. 93-118, (2015); Alhenawi, Yasser, Value creation and the probability of success in merger and acquisition transactions, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 49, 4, pp. 1041-1085, (2017); International Journal of Management Business Studies, (2016); Amihud, Yakov, RISK REDUCTION AS A MANAGERIAL MOTIVE FOR CONGLOMERATE MERGERS., 12, 2, pp. 605-617, (1981); Review of Economic and Business Studies, (2016); Finance Challenges of the Future Yea, (2013); Bauer, Florian Andreas, Contextualizing speed and cross-border acquisition performance: Labor market flexibility and efficiency effects, Journal of World Business, 53, 2, pp. 290-301, (2018); Berrioategortua, Joaquín Sanz, Does company performance improve after m&a?

This also applies to family businesses, albeit the development and improvement in their market situation must be the most important – indeed, the only – endeavour. Therefore, the question arises as to what extent financial results and relevant development trends may affect the level of accomplishment of the entire range of family business ob-jectives. The objective of the article is to examine the impact of changes in selected measures revealing the company’s financial situation on the level of the accomplishment of family business objectives. The article is based on the results of a survey conducted on a group of 182 family business man-agers, who were asked to assess trends concerning selected measures of financial condition and the extent to which 22 family business objectives had been accomplished. These objectives were grouped into five main objectives during the statistical analysis phase. The impact of development trends concerning financial measures on the level of the accomplishment of objectives was examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The results obtained indicate that the level of accomplishment of family business objectives is only slightly correlated with the development trends of selected financial measures. In the case of family objectives, no statistically significant impact of changes in any of the measures was recorded, while the level of accomplishment of the business objectives and the family business objective is determined by changes in only some indicators. The approach suggested in this article, consisting in examining the relationships between the development trends of financial measures and the level of accomplishment of family business objectives, is an innovative approach which indicates new directions for research and helps to fill the research gap. It is in line with research on family businesses and financial measures, while confirming that family objectives can be achieved to a certain extent regardless of financial results. The results obtained may also be useful for family business managers in the process of establishing the compa-ny’s operational strategy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Family Business; Family Business Goals; Financial Indicators; Financial Results","","","","","Abughniem, Manal Sulieman, Corporate sustainability as an antecedent to the financial performance: An empirical study, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 20, 2, pp. 35-44, (2019); Maga Zyn Firm Rodzinnych, (2017); Agarwal, Manoj K., The impact of a manufacturer's financial liquidity on its market strategies and pricing and promotion decisions in retail grocery markets, Journal of Business Research, 142, pp. 844-857, (2022); Ahmed, Rizwan, The implications of liquidity ratios: Evidence from Pakistan stock exchange limited, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 87, pp. 235-243, (2023); Global Economics and Management Review, (2015); Allouche, José, The impact of family control on the performance and financial characteristics of family versus nonfamily businesses in Japan: A matched-pair investigation, Family Business Review, 21, 4, pp. 315-329, (2008); Aparicio, Gloria, An exploratory study of firm goals in the context of family firms: An institutional logics perspective, Journal of Family Business Strategy, 8, 3, pp. 157-169, (2017); Finanse Rynki Finansowe Ubezpieczenia, (2016); Attaoui, Sami, Write-Down Bonds and Capital and Debt Structures, Journal of Corporate Finance, 35, pp. 97-119, (2015); Ayu, Maristiana, The impact of environmental and social costs disclosure on financial performance mediating by earning management, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 21, 2, pp. 74-86, (2020)","","WSB University","","","","","","23534435; 23005947","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139095191"

Unlike earlier research in Thailand, this article uses a three-level hierarchical regression model to examine the moderating effects of board independence and the separation of chairman–chief executive officer (CEO) duality roles on the firm’s value of the Thai listed firms between 2010 and 2019. This study confirms a negative relationship between family ownership and a firm’s value in Thailand. Nevertheless, it reveals that the association between family ownership and firm’s value becomes positive if the Thai listed firms have a high proportion of independent directors. Further evidence confirms that the separation of chairman–CEO duality roles can increase a firm’s value, but it cannot solely enhance the value in those firms with high family ownership.

Hence, the firm should be more careful on changes of working capital management. The study explores the impact of changes of working capital management on firm value using 200 listed non-financial firms from Thailand and Singapore from 2009 to 2018. By employing static panel data regressions, the study demonstrates that shareholders in Thailand perceive an extra working capital investment is significantly less worth than an extra Thai baht of cash investment. Conversely, shareholders in Singapore perceive that extra Singapore dollar of cash investment and extra working capital investment reduces firm value. These different results from both countries are expected due to the different levels of market development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Changes Of Working Capital Management; Firm Value; Singapore; Thailand","","","","","Afrifa, Godfred A., Working capital management, cash flow and SMEs' performance, International Journal of Banking, Accounting and Finance, 9, 1, pp. 19-43, (2018); Ahangar, Nufazil Altaf, Financial constraints and speed of working capital adjustment, Asia-Pacific Journal of Business Administration, 12, 3-4, pp. 371-385, (2020); Akbar, Ahsan, Do working capital management practices influence investment and financing patterns of firms?, Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences, 38, 1, pp. 91-109, (2022); Aktas, Nihat, CEO Duality, Agency Costs, and Internal Capital Allocation Efficiency, British Journal of Management, 30, 2, pp. 473-493, (2019); Amarteifio, Edward Nii Amar, Investment readiness and access to external finance among Ghanaian small and medium-size enterprises, International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business, 37, 2, pp. 214-231, (2019); Amponsah-Kwatiah, Kofi, Working capital management and profitability of listed manufacturing firms in Ghana, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 70, 7, pp. 1751-1771, (2021); Ashraf, Badar Nadeem, Economic policy uncertainty and banks’ loan pricing, Journal of Financial Stability, 44, (2019); Axiotis, Dimitris, How the working capital management influences companies’ profitability: Case study of Greek pharmaceutical companies, International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business, 37, 4, pp. 530-544, (2019); Bachiller, Patricia, Financial derivatives and firm value: What have we learned?, Finance Research Letters, 39, (2021); Baños-Caballero, Sonia, Net operating working capital and firm value: A cross-country analysis, BRQ Business Research Quarterly, 23, 3, pp. 234-251, (2020)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","10974954; 17451329","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138020865"

This research aims to examine how the interest rate, prudential capital, and their interaction impact banking profitability in emerging economies like Egypt. The final sample of banks registered by the Central Bank of Egypt comprises 22 banks during the period of 2011–2020. The cross-sectional time-series Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression approach is used to estimate the panel data. The findings confirm that low-interest rates indeed harm banks’ profitability. In addition, higher prudential capital enhances the profitability of banks. Importantly, the impact of low-interest rates on bank profitability can be diminished only when banks are maintaining higher prudential capital. Based on the findings, it is recommended that bank managers and policymakers in Egypt as well as in similar emerging economies shall promote the application of the Basel Capital Accord to increasingly strengthen the profitability of banks, which in turn reinforces the performance of the banking sector, especially during low-interest rate times. The findings also reveal that bank-specific characteristics such as large bank size, increased efficiency, and less concentrated market enhance banks’ profitability. Overall, the findings of this research are highly relevant since improved profitability is one of the main objectives of bank supervisors and regulators. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Size; Banking Regulations; Efficiency; Emerging Economies; Low-interest Rates; Market Share; Profitability","","","","","Adesina, Kolade Sunday, How diversification affects bank performance: The role of human capital, Economic Modelling, 94, pp. 303-319, (2021); Agoraki, Maria Eleni K., The determinants of performance in the Eurozone banking sector: Core versus periphery Eurozone economies, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 1, pp. 416-429, (2021); Mirzaei, Ali, Capital inflows and bank stability around the financial crisis: The mitigating role of macro-prudential policies, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 69, (2020); Almaqtari, Faozi A., The determinants of profitability of Indian commercial banks: A panel data approach, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 24, 1, pp. 168-185, (2019); Do Van Anh, Does better capitalization enhance bank efficiency and limit risk taking?

We develop a corporate governance index (CGI) and investigate its impact on firms’ performance. The index consists of 32 unique internal governance attributes that were built based on Jordanian governance Code. This study used a quantitative research method using panel dataset analysis of 672-firm year observations. Fixed effects regression model was employed to analyse the governance-performance nexus. To infer correctly, we re-examine the main analysis using a well-developed dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to overcome possible endogeneity concerns. Consistent with prior studies in developed and developing countries in the governance literature, our findings robustly disclose that compliance with CG guidelines is a determinant of corporate performance of listed firms in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) during period 2009–2016. The results indicate that a better degree of compliance with the Jordanian code and guidelines is positively and significantly related with better performance of publicly listed firms. This study contributes theoretically and practically to growing but under-developed literature on governance compliance and corporate performance in developing countries.

A sample size of 800 firm-year observations between 2010 and 2019 utilizes multivariant regression for data interpretation. Our results suggest that CEO duality is statistically insignificant to influence employer-support volunteerism. Second, ageing CEOs have a statistically significant and positive effect on influencing employer-support volunteerism in India. Third, male CEOs have a statistically significant and positive effect on influencing employer-support volunteerism in India. Fourth, family firms are insignificant to influence employer-support volunteerism. However, in a moderating study, family-controlled firms reduce the efficiency in CEO duality towards employer-support volunteerism in India. Fifth, the interactive study shows that ageing and male CEOs in family firms positively influence employer-support volunteerism. Regarding the control variables, we found that ﬁrm size and type of industry are sensitive to employer-support volunteerism in India. The study implies that a CEO non-duality can better address support for volunteerism. Similarly, the characteristics of ageing CEOs are associated with experience and the general desire to undertake volunteerism. Likewise is the engagement of male CEOs who pursue community engagement better than female CEOs. The implication from the study to shareholders and any party interest (example: community) seeking a firm to pursue CSR activities through volunteerism must support CEO non-duality, ageing CEOs and male CEOs’ engagements. Also, family or non-family firms still benefit from undertaking volunteerism when the firms engage ageing CEOs and male CEOs. The results of the study are robust after controlling for firm-specific variables. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Age; Ceo Duality; Ceo Gender; Employer-support Volunteerism; Family-controlled Firms; India","","","","","Adel, Christine, Is corporate governance relevant to the quality of corporate social responsibility disclosure in large European companies?, International Journal of Accounting and Information Management, 27, 2, pp. 301-332, (2019); Adomako, Samuel, Politically connected firms and corporate social responsibility implementation expenditure in sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Ghana, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 6, pp. 2701-2711, (2020); Angood, Peter B., THE VALUE OF VOLUNTEERING, Physician Leadership Journal, 2, 2, pp. 4-6, (2015); Artis, Keon, Motivations of federal workers to volunteer in public sector special events, Event Management, 24, 1, pp. 33-46, (2020); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

Despite the interest in the adoption of corporate governance state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the performance of these organisations remains poor (Vagliasindi, 2008), which has been attributed to ineffective corporate governance (World Bank, 2007). The objective of this study was to develop a strategic corporate governance enterprise in the developing economy. The study followed a critical realism approach. As a result, a multi-methodology and mixed design were employed. The sample included all SOEs registered in Malawi, which had operated from 2000-2016 but excluded regulatory, financial, and academic institutions. Data collection followed the critical realism case study method. Findings reveal that large power distance, cronyism, and materialistic cultures are entrenched in society and negatively impact corporate governance. Results further show that increased shareholders’ power and multiple principals have a negative effect on performance. The study recommended changes to legal form, board operations, and disclosure to improve corporate governance effectiveness. The study has contributed to a body of knowledge in terms of developing a strategic governance framework for SOEs in Malawi. The study has also established that cultural values influence the effectiveness of corporate governance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Company Performance; Framework Of Soes; Malawi; Socio-cultural Values; State-owned Enterprises; Strategic Corporate Governance","","","","","Sheikh, Nadeem Ahmed, The impact of capital structure on performance: An empirical study of non-financial listed firms in Pakistan, International Journal of Commerce and Management, 23, 4, pp. 354-368, (2013); J Manag, (2019); Bae, Sung C., Culture, corporate governance, and dividend policy: International evidence, Journal of Financial Research, 35, 2, pp. 289-316, (2012); Baxamusa, Mufaddal, Does religion affect capital structure?, Research in International Business and Finance, 31, pp. 112-131, (2014); Bhat, Kalim Ullah, Corporate governance and firm value: a comparative analysis of state and non-state owned companies in the context of Pakistan, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 18, 6, pp. 1196-1206, (2018); Boateng, Agyenim, National culture, corporate governance and corruption: A cross-country analysis, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 3, pp. 3852-3874, (2021); Boytsun, Andriy, Social Norms, Social Cohesion, and Corporate Governance, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 19, 1, pp. 41-60, (2011); Bozec, Richard, Boards of directors, market discipline and firm performance, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 32, 9-10, pp. 1921-1960, (2005); Blundell, Richard W., Initial conditions and moment restrictions in dynamic panel data models, Journal of Econometrics, 87, 1, pp. 115-143, (1998); Callen, Jeffrey Lawrence, Do culture and religion mitigate earnings management?

Using data envelopment analysis (DEA), firm efficiency is measured, and afterward, this firm efficiency is regressed on firm size, market share of the company, business segment and foreign currency translation. The residual values are the measurements of managerial behaviour. The data for 11 years (2009–2019) was collected from 492 non-financial firms listed on the stock exchanges of Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. The results are obtained by applying the system dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) to address the problem of endogeneity. The study’s main findings prove that corporate governance, measured by the board structure index, positively modifies the relationship of managerial behaviour with firm performance in all three emerging economies. Secondly, the results show positive influence of managerial behaviour on both measures of firm performance (Tobin’s Q and return on assets (ROA)) in Bangladesh and Pakistan scenarios, but negative impact on ROA and inconclusive on Tobin’s Q in the Indian context.

This paper took a qualitative approach to examine 30 scholarly articles from 18 countries in four geographic regions. The results provided a list of 17 common financial performance determinants found out of various studies. These determinants included 14 firm-specific determinants (company size, leverage, liquidity, company age, premium growth, underwriting risk, tangibility, risk ratio, retention ratio, loss ratio, expense ratio, growth rate, claim ratio, and solvency margin) and contained three macroeconomic determinants (inflation rate, economic growth rate and interest rate). Also, the results indicated that the return on asset (ROA) is the most financial measurements used as dependent variables. Furthermore, the results revealed that many of the empirical studies employed multiple regressions and it was discovered that the fixed effects model was an appropriate model.

To improve GTI, university-industry alliances (U-Is) in green innovation ecosystems engage in knowledge-sharing behaviors and form different knowledge-sharing strategies based on changes in cooperation modes. Employing a differential game, this study explores the utility of multichannel funding for innovation revenues in different cooperative modes of U-Is and the impact on revenue distributions. This article considers three game models in five cases: Nash noncooperative game with no multichannel funding, Nash noncooperative game with external funding but no government subsidies, Nash noncooperative game with multichannel funding, Stackelberg game, and cooperative game. Solving the game model and applying the numerical analysis results in certain interesting conclusions. Our research finds that, first, in the cooperative game, the strongest willingness to share knowledge occurs in the university-industry alliance, in which the total revenues of both parties reach the Pareto optimum. Second, multichannel funding can serve as an incentive mechanism for enterprises and universities to improve the knowledge-sharing willingness, the GTI level, and the revenues of the two players, while the utility of the multichannel funding is strongest in the cooperative game. In addition, in the Stackelberg game, enterprises share subsidies with universities, which stimulates their willingness to share knowledge, and both parties' revenues are better than they are in the three cases of noncooperation. Eventually, the revenue-sharing ratio of the enterprise has a smaller threshold, and the university can share more benefits relative to the absence of the multichannel funding, which helps balance the U-I in the green innovation ecosystem. These conclusions make a substantial contribution to the selection of cooperation modes and the formulation of revenues distribution contracts in university-industry alliances. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Green Innovation Ecosystem; Green Technology Innovation; Knowledge Sharing; Multichannel Funding; University-industry; Biological Systems; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental Technology; Game Theory; Knowledge Management; Pareto Principle; Biological System Modeling; Fundings; Game; Government; Green Innovation Ecosystem; Green Innovations; Green Products; Green Technology; Green Technology Innovation; Knowledge-sharing; Multi Channel; Multichannel Funding; Technological Innovation; Technology Innovation; University Industries; Investments","Biological systems; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental technology; Game theory; Knowledge management; Pareto principle; Biological system modeling; Fundings; Game; Government; Green innovation ecosystem; Green innovations; Green products; Green technology; Green technology innovation; Knowledge-sharing; Multi channel; Multichannel funding; Technological innovation; Technology innovation; University industries; Investments","","","This work was supported in part by the National Social Science Foundation of China under Grant 20XGL030.","Yang, Zhi, How does alliance-based government-university-industry foster cleantech innovation in a green innovation ecosystem?, Journal of Cleaner Production, 283, (2021); Wang, Yanli, Green finance innovation and regional green development, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 15, (2021); Shi, Yin, Enhancing the competitiveness of multi-agent cooperation for green manufacturing in China: An empirical study of the measure of green technology innovation capabilities and their influencing factors, Sustainable Production and Consumption, 23, pp. 63-76, (2020); Rohrbeck, René, Opening up for competitive advantage - How Deutsche telekom creates an open innovation ecosystem, R and D Management, 39, 4, pp. 420-430, (2009); Bagherzadeh, Mehdi, Managing Open Innovation: A Project-Level Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 68, 1, pp. 301-316, (2021); Costa, Joana, Open innovation 4.0 as an enhancer of sustainable innovation ecosystems, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 19, (2020); Chang, Shuhao, The technology networks and development trends of university-industry collaborative patents, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 118, pp. 107-113, (2017); J Small Bus Manage, (2021); Ankrah, Samuel N., Asking both university and industry actors about their engagement in knowledge transfer: What single-group studies of motives omit, Technovation, 33, 2-3, pp. 50-65, (2013); International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology, (2017)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133603151"

Such nationwide lockdowns further exacerbated the financial distress, a long-standing challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In this study, we examine how corporate governance forms like promoters’ ownership, financial performance and market competition affect the distress of listed SMEs, both in the pre-COVID-19 era and during the COVID-19 period. To do so, the study adopts a two-fold sampling and multi-methodology approach. First, by applying panel data analysis on the first sample of 80 listed SMEs for the financial year (FY), FY 2017–2018 to FY 2019–2020, pre-COVID-19 period results are obtained. Second, by applying cross-sectional analysis on the second sample of 155 listed SMEs for FY 2020–2021, results during the COVID-19 period are obtained. Main results indicate that previous years’ distress determines distress in the current year in the pre-COVID-19 era. In addition, promoters’ ownership and return on equity reduce the possibility of distress, while current period competition is insignificant. Conversely, COVID-19 can exacerbate distress and render promoters’ ownership insignificant. Furthermore, the COVID-19 period is characterized by reduced asset utilization. Therefore, any marginal increase in return on assets reduces distress. Interestingly, MC becomes an active determinant of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, episodes like COVID-19 can modify the impact behaviour of the aforementioned determinants of distress. Notably, the results highlight the fragility of internal governance forms like ownership effects, while establishing the dominance of external factors like competition during the COVID-19 period. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Financial Distress; Financial Performance; Listed Smes; Market Competition; Promoters’ Ownership","","","","","Abdallah, Abed Al Nasser, Corporate governance practices, ownership structure, and corporate performance in the GCC countries, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 46, pp. 98-115, (2017); Afrifa, Godfred A., Corporate governance and performance of UK listed small and medium enterprises, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 15, 5, pp. 719-733, (2015); Al-Fadly, Ahmad, Impact of covid-19 on smes and employment, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, 8, 2, pp. 629-648, (2020); Asian Journal of Accounting Perspectives, (2018); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z- Score and ZETA® models, pp. 428-455, (2013); Balasubramanian, Senthil Arasu, Modeling corporate financial distress using financial and non-financial variables: The case of Indian listed companies, International Journal of Law and Management, 61, 3-4, pp. 457-484, (2019); Bhattacharjee, Arnab, Financial distress of Chinese firms: Microeconomic, macroeconomic and institutional influences, China Economic Review, 30, pp. 244-262, (2014); Arellano, Manuel, Some tests of specification for panel data:monte carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Harvard Business Review, (2020)","","Sage Publications India Pvt.

There are clear differences in the keywords used in various time periods to describe the person or entity providing CSR, the CSR activity provided, and the intended recipients or targets of any CSR activities. There has been a trend away from individuals such as managers or specific groups such as employees being identified as providers or recipients of CSR towards keywords describing CSR as an organizational responsibility that is provided to large and inclusive groups such as communities or abstract entities such as stakeholders or the environment. Since the millennium, there has been considerable convergence in CSR keywords that appears to be driven by the availability of CSR information via the internet. The changes in CSR keywords appear to parallel changes in societal expectations, regulation and legislation, and the wider business environment. This suggests that corporations deploy CSR defensively to express alignment with prevailing public priorities, stress compliance with government directives and emphasise conformity with corporate contemporaries. The implications of these findings are discussed and possible lines for future research are proposed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Definition; Discourse; Social Construction; Stakeholders; Terminology","","","","","Third Sector Comparative Studies of Nonprofit Organizations, (1990); Bodhanwala, Shernaz, Does corporate sustainability impact firm profitability?

From August 22, 2012, through September 17, 2021, the daily bond yield indices for Islamic and G6 markets were employed. The findings reveal that volatility spillovers between and within Islamic and/or G6 bond markets are time- and frequency-dependent, although conventional bonds are more volatile than Islamic bonds during Black Swan periods. Across all time horizons, USA, UK, and Canada are the biggest producers of shocks to the Islamic and G6 markets, with Pakistan being the lowest shocks transmitter. During the European debt crisis, Brexit, and COVID-19 periods, the results underscore delayed contagious spillovers emanating from USA, Canada, and UK. With both the Islamic and G6 bond markets, short-term spillovers are more important than long-term spillovers. Investors should use their understanding of market trends and volatility to hedge their holdings against poorer asset returns when volatility spillover is more severe during market turmoil. Spillovers should be closely monitored by policymakers, since they jeopardise cross-market linkages. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","OECD Warns Coronavirus could Halve Global Growth, (2020); Economics in the Time of Covid 19, (2020); Albulescu, Claudiu Tiberiu, COVID-19 and the United States financial markets’ volatility, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Guo, Yanhong, Tail risk contagion between international financial markets during COVID-19 pandemic, International Review of Financial Analysis, 73, (2021); Gupta, Rangan, Infectious disease-related uncertainty and the safe-haven characteristic of US treasury securities, International Review of Economics and Finance, 71, pp. 289-298, (2021); Yarovaya, Larisa, Determinants of Spillovers between Islamic and Conventional Financial Markets: Exploring the Safe Haven Assets during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Finance Research Letters, 43, (2021); Spillover of Covid 19 Impact on the Global Economy, (2020); Sukuk and Covid 19 how Islamic Bonds can Help, (2020); Journal of Finance, (1970); Journal of Finance, (1970)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","1607887X; 10260226","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128212449"

Furthermore, the study examines the viability of various potential determinants of profitability led by primary bank-specific variables: cost-income ratio, bank size, debt ratio, and non-performing loans. The main objective is to assess if and how capital adequacy ratios have had any measurable effects along with other bank-specific variables on bank profitability that is determined by the return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The study’s main takeaway is that ROA is negatively correlated with the four capital adequacy ratios. However, mixed results are observed when ROE is used as a proxy for bank profitability. ROE is positively affected by both core capital to risk-weighted assets ratio and total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio. On the contrary, ROE is negatively affected by the core capital to total assets ratio and total equity capital to total assets ratio. It can be argued that the most significant finding in this paper is that the impact on bank profitability differs according to the proxy used for capital adequacy. Furthermore, the cost-income ratio is inversely related to both bank profitability measures and both bank profitability measures are inversely affected by the non-performing loan ratio. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Capital Adequacy; Bank Profitability; Basel Ii","","","","","International Journal of Management and Sustainability, (2014); European Journal of Economics Finance and Administrative Sciences, (2015); Akhtar, Muhammad Farhan, Factors influencing the profitability of Islamic banks of Pakistan, International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 66, pp. 125-132, (2011); Economics, (2015); Asian Journal of Finance Accounting, (2014); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Sciences, (2013); Alshatti, Ali Sulieman, Determinants of banks' profitability - The case of Jordan, Investment Management and Financial Innovations, 13, 1, pp. 84-91, (2016); Norwegian Banks in A Recession Procyclical Implications of Basel II, (2009); Impact of Basel II Regulation in the European Banking Market A Panel Data Analysis Approach, (2013); Ilomata International Journal of Management, (2020)","","Virtus Interpress","","","","","","22209352; 23066784","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127435970"

Contrary to what is expected, net revenues do not moderate the relationship between liquidity and solvency and banks’ profitability; and hence the related hypotheses were rejected. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ase And Wcm; Banks’ Profitability; Jordanian Banks; Liquidity; Solvency","","","","","Abuzayed, Bana M., Working capital management and firms' performance in emerging markets: The case of Jordan, International Journal of Managerial Finance, 8, 2, pp. 155-179, (2012); Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2015); European Journal of Business and Management, (2013); International Journal of Empirical Finance, (2014); Al-Ajlouni, Ahmed Taha M., Interest free liquidity management scheme (time-weighted debt units), International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 10, 1, pp. 60-76, (2017); Al-Okaily, Aws, Measuring success of accounting information system: Applying the delone and mclean model at the organizational level, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 98, 14, pp. 2697-2706, (2020); Al-Okaily, Aws, An empirical investigation of enterprise system user satisfaction antecedents in Jordanian commercial banks, Cogent Business and Management, 8, 1, (2021); J Sustain Finance Invest, (2021); Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2014); Jordan Journal of Business Administration, (2015)","Musleh Al-Sartawi, A.M.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","International Conference on Global Economic Revolutions, ICGER 2021","","Virtual, Online","271469","23673389; 23673370","9789819652372; 9783031931055; 9789819662968; 9783031999963; 9783031950162; 9783031947698; 9783032004406; 9783031910074; 9783031926105; 9789819639410","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124139430"

The predictors under consideration are the quality of the corporate governance system (assessed through a comprehensive index), state ownership concentration, industry sector characteristics, and company size. Our cross-sectional sample consists of data for 63 state-controlled enterprises in Romania for the financial year 2018. The data were collected by hand, using two new instruments: a content analysis scale for NFR according to the European Directive 2014/95/EU and a corporate governance index for SOEs. We classify Romanian SOEs into two clusters: ‘high disclosure–good governance’ and ‘low disclosure–poor governance,’ for which we present the particularities of NFR and corporate governance. In line with agency theory and stakeholder theory, we show that the NFR quality score is positively correlated with the corporate governance score, company size, environmental impact, monopolistic position, and the state’s strategic interest, but negatively correlated with state ownership concentration. Our results also indicate that an increase in the state’s blockholding will negatively affect the quality of the corporate governance system, and will ultimately decrease the quality of the company’s non-financial disclosures. We conclude that the quality of the governance system is a mediating variable between the state’s ownership concentration and the quality of NFR. Our results are helpful to professionals and policymakers in understanding the path toward the material harmonization of reporting practices at a European level for SOEs and private entities alike. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Theory; Central And Eastern Europe; Corporate Governance; Non-financial Reporting; Romania; Stakeholder Theory; State-owned Enterprises","","","","This work was supported by the Bucharest University of Economic Studies, Romania [Project title: Corporate Governance of State-Owned Entities in Romania].","Abad Navarro, María Cristina, On the ‘Disclosure Initiative–Principles of Disclosure’: The EAA Financial Reporting Standards Committee’s View, Accounting in Europe, 17, 1, pp. 1-32, (2020); Mohamed Adnan, Shayuti, The influence of culture and corporate governance on corporate social responsibility disclosure: A cross country analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 198, pp. 820-832, (2018); Albu, Cătălin Nicolae, Compliance with corporate governance codes in emerging economies.

The paper considers the relationship between customer satisfaction, earnings, and firm value as these drives change in stock prices, customer, and investor sentiment. The present study investigates the impact of customer sentiment polarity on stock prices based on Indian automobile sector databased such as the Indian Nifty Auto SNE (Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher). A top-down approach is adopted to construct a financial proxy-based sentiment index completed with sentiment extracted from automobile news and customer reviews. The paper uses a text mining approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices. The study was initially performed at the overall individual stock from the Nifty Auto NSE but focused on the top three passenger vehicle manufacturing companies i.e., Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Eicher. It was found that the sentiment index was augmented with news and customer reviews allows predicting more accurately NIFTY AUTO stock price movements. This implies that customer sentiment is a major driver of investor sentiment which in turn impacts the stock market and the firm value. Thus, the present study is an integrated approach to holistically measure customer sentiment's impact on investor sentiment and stock prices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customer Sentiment; Firm Value; Research Methods; Social Media; Text Mining; Automobiles; Automotive Industry; Costs; Customer Satisfaction; Data Mining; Financial Markets; Investments; Shareholders; Social Networking (online); Customer Experience; Customer Review; Customer Sentiment; Firm Value; Investor's Sentiments; Research Method; Sentiment Index; Social Media; Stock Price; Text-mining; Sales; Firm Size; Innovation; Integrated Approach; Profitability; Social Media; Technological Development; India; Lateolabrax Japonicus","Automobiles; Automotive industry; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Data mining; Financial markets; Investments; Shareholders; Social networking (online); Customer experience; Customer review; Customer sentiment; Firm value; Investor's sentiments; Research method; Sentiment index; Social media; Stock price; Text-mining; Sales; firm size; innovation; integrated approach; profitability; social media; technological development; India; Lateolabrax japonicus","","","","Aksoy, Lerzan M., The long-term stock market valuation of customer satisfaction, Journal of Marketing, 72, 4, pp. 105-122, (2008); Anastasia, Sonia, Twitter sentiment analysis of online transportation service providers, pp. 359-365, (2017); Anderson, Eugene W., Foundations of the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Total Quality Management, 11, 7, pp. 869-882, (2000); Journal of Asset Management, (2006); Al-Otaibi, Shaha T., Customer satisfaction measurement using sentiment analysis, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 9, 2, pp. 106-117, (2018); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns, Journal of Finance, 61, 4, pp. 1645-1680, (2006); Ba, Sulin, Stock market reaction to green vehicle innovation, Production and Operations Management, 22, 4, pp. 976-990, (2013); Baker, Malcolm P., Multinationals as arbitrageurs: The effect of stock market valuations on foreign direct investment, Review of Financial Studies, 22, 1, pp. 337-369, (2009); Economics in the Time of Covid 19, (2020); undefined, (2013)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00401625","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116946304"

This chapter aims to present a hybrid MCDM approach to evaluate the Vietnamese banking sector's performance under COVID-19 impacts. The proposed method utilizes The Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) technique to determine objective weights of financial ratios. Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is employed to obtain the cause-effect relationship and the subjective weights based on experts’ judgments. Bank alternatives’ ranking is estimated using the ﻿Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. The empirical data of 23 Vietnamese commercial banks gathered from 2019-Q3/2020 is illustrated. The results of this chapter show that the COVID-19 pandemic has significant effects on the quality of assets, the liquidity of banks, and the growth rate. When the economy slows down, banks face the challenge of keeping up with demand and raising additional resources to balance the situation. For better intelligent risk management systems, faster digital transformation is needed for the Vietnamese banking system.

Using a sample of 117 UK HEIs over a 6-year period (i.e., 702 university-year observations), we find that the level of governance disclosures among HEIs in the UK is generally low, which is consistent with the findings of earlier studies on the general disclosure practices among HEIs. We also find that vice-chancellor characteristics and governing board mechanisms have a significant impact on voluntary governance disclosures. Specifically, we find a positive and significant association among vice-chancellor tenure, governing board independence, governing board meetings, the presence of a governance committee, and voluntary governance disclosures. By contrast, we find that vice-chancellor age and governing board ethnic/gender diversity have a negative association with the governance disclosures, whereas vice-chancellor gender and education background have no association with the governance disclosures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Governance Quality; Reforms; Uk Higher Education Institutions (heis); Voluntary Disclosure","","","","We are grateful to the Editor-in-Chief, Professor Robert K.

Most of extant studies on early warning models merely take the financial factors into account, whereas strategic risk pertaining to firms involves a diverse group of non-financial factors. In addition, the growing attention attached to the sustainable development of ecological and social environment has raised specific concerns to manufacturing firms, which need especially manage the risks generated from the process of sustainable innovation. However, scholars have paid far less attention to early warning models that comprehensively address the above problems. It is crucial to facilitate manufacturing firms to timely detect strategic risk during the process of sustainable innovation, whereas the existing early warning models are not reliable enough to warn the potential risks. Therefore, this study sets out to introduce the sustainable risk into the early warning indicators system of strategic risk. Then, Chinese manufacturing firms are applied to construct an early warning model which based on the back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The results provide evidence that the proposed model shows a better fitting effect, higher prediction precision and higher convergence speed when compared with conventional models. In addition, the weights of the early warning model obtained from the training are substituted into the forward propagation formula, which enables to determine the relative importance of risk factors. It is of great significance for the firms to prioritize risk management actions. Furthermore, the new model enables manufacturing firms to warn the strategic risk during the process of sustainable innovation while striking a balance among economic, environmental, and social performances. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Early Warning; Manufacturing Firms; Optimized Bp Neural Network; Strategic Risk; Sustainable Innovation; Genetic Algorithms; Manufacture; Neural Networks; Sustainable Development; Back-propagation Neural Networks; Early Warning; Early-warning Models; Ecological Environments; Financial Factors; Manufacturing Firms; Neural Network Model; Optimized Back-propagation Neural Network; Strategic Risks; Sustainable Innovation; Risk Management","Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Neural networks; Sustainable development; Back-propagation neural networks; Early warning; Early-warning models; Ecological environments; Financial factors; Manufacturing firms; Neural network model; Optimized back-propagation neural network; Strategic risks; Sustainable innovation; Risk management","","","The paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (Grant NO. 71663058 , No. 71573234 ), Applied Basic Research Key Project of Yunnan Province (Grant NO. 2018FA037 ), and the Yunnan Philosophy and Social Science Innovation Team Project .

We address this question by studying the environmental performance of US banks and its impact on their tail risk as US is not committed to carbon neutrality in COP 21. We proxy economic reality with tail risk of banks and employ a novel extreme value theory to measure this. We use Asset4 ESG data for environmental performance score and test our hypothesis with a sample of 256 US banks. The results indicate that the US banks are ecologically ambitious and their environmental strategies are likely to reduce their tail risk. This provides evidence that better environmental strategies do coincide with the economic realities. We test the consistency of our results by using alternate proxies for tail risk and find our results robust. Our results are also not driven by endogeneity concerns.

Specifically, we depart from the predominately quantitative-orientated SEPs literature by conducting in-depth interviews and analysis of owners and managers of SMEs in the United Kingdom within a legitimacy theoretical framework. Our findings from a comprehensive number of interviewees show that SMEs employ a complex mix of both symbolic and substantive SEPs with the aim of enhancing the legitimacy and sustainability of their operations. The results emphasise the strengths of social engagement, reputation and image, environmental embeddedness, industry differentiation and education facilitators. In particular, the paper shows that legitimating strategies can have a dual purpose of being symbolic in nature but also inferring a substantive legitimacy claim. Evidence of SMEs maintaining their legitimacy position stretches further via either a moral and/or a pragmatic standpoint. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Performance; Environmental Policy And Sustainability; Legitimacy Theory; Smes; Social And Environmental Practices; Substantive And Symbolic Legitimation; Uk; Environmental Planning; Environmental Policy; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Sustainability; Theory; United Kingdom","environmental planning; environmental policy; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability; theory; United Kingdom","","","","Ackerman, Laurence D., The Psychology of Corporation: How Identity Influences Business, Journal of Business Strategy, 5, 1, pp. 56-65, (1984); Adams, Carol A., The internet and change in corporate stakeholder engagement and communication strategies on social and environmental performance, Journal of Accounting and Organizational Change, 2, 3, pp. 281-303, (2006); Aerts, Walter, Media legitimacy and corporate environmental communication, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 34, 1, pp. 1-27, (2009); Alrazi, Bakhtiar, A comprehensive literature review on, and the construction of a framework for, environmental legitimacy, accountability and proactivity, Journal of Cleaner Production, 102, pp. 44-57, (2015); Amato, Louis H., The effects of firm size and industry on corporate giving, Journal of Business Ethics, 72, 3, pp. 229-241, (2007); Aragón-Correa, Juan Alberto Alberto, Environmental strategy and performance in small firms: A resource-based perspective, Journal of Environmental Management, 86, 1, pp. 88-103, (2008); Organization Science, (1990); Aslam, Shoaib, Environmental management practices and financial performance using data envelopment analysis in Japan: The mediating role of environmental performance, Business Strategy and the Environment, 30, 4, pp. 1655-1673, (2021); Bansal, Pratima (Tima), Talking trash: Legitimacy, impression management, and unsystematic risk in the context of the natural environment, Academy of Management Journal, 47, 1, pp. 93-103, (2004); Critical State of Corporate Social Responsibility in Europe, (2019)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106696106"

We use a dynamic multivariate framework to estimate time-varying correlations, which we submit to beta and sigma-convergence analysis. Subsequently we examine how convergence dynamics affect portfolio risk management and crisis propagation. Our results show strong convergence of Islamic and conventional investments. During crises conventional convergence rates double, but Islamic ones are less affected. Sectoral diversification works best for conventional investments; Islamic ones behave as a single entity. On average we document a 7% risk diversification benefit from Islamic investments, at a 64 basis points cost. Yet, at the epicentre of the Covid-19 financial crisis this rises to 466 basis points and highlights the resilience of these investments in an exogenous event. Islamic investments reduce volatility spillovers in the financial system, but they are progressively less insulated across time.

This is even more important for emerging economies that have constrained financial markets. In this paper, using monthly data between 2011 and 2019, we study 6519 actively managed mutual funds in BRICS after sorting them into black, brown, and green categories based on their investment holdings. Our comparative performance shows that green funds outperform their counterparts for the entire sample and within-country assessment. We also document the volatility and market timing ability of green funds, mainly absent in high emission funds. The results remained robust for various definitions of performance.

We employ tests of differences in means and variances of various risk-return measures as well as mean-variance spanning and intersection tests in order to uncover the diversification potentials of Sukuk in the portfolio management industry. Our results suggest that bond funds, of which the portfolios are composed of a combination of Sukuk and conventional bonds (i.e. mixed bond funds), have a relatively “lower risk-higher return” profile.

And compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, foreign investors even exhibit stronger negative feedback trading. Further analyses confirm that foreign investors’ negative feedback is mainly driven by their response to negative returns.

This paper analyses whether WCM policies affect the economic and financial profitability of Spanish companies in the fish canning industry. Spain leads the EU's production of canned seafood and the seafood industry is a key sector for the Spanish economy. To assess the WCM-profitability relationship, we applied a dynamic panel data methodology in a sample consisting of 377 companies during the period 2010–2018. We can conclude that the economic profitability of fish canning companies is related to the collection period (Days Sales Outstanding or DSO) and the inventory conversion period (Days Inventory Outstanding or DIO). Moreover, empirical evidence reveals the existence of an optimal level of receivables that balances the benefits of increasing sales and the opportunity costs of customer funding. The findings also identify a convex relationship between investment in inventory and economic profitability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Canned Seafood Companies; Cash Conversion Cycle (ccc); Collection Period; Payment Period; Profitability; Working Capital Management (wcm); Capital; European Union; Fish; Investment; Profitability; Seafood; Spain","capital; European Union; fish; investment; profitability; seafood; Spain","","","","undefined, (2019); Afrifa, Godfred A., Working capital level influence on SME profitability, Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 23, 1, pp. 44-63, (2016); Arellano, Manuel, Some tests of specification for panel data:monte carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Baños-Caballero, Sonia, Working capital management, corporate performance, and financial constraints, Journal of Business Research, 67, 3, pp. 332-338, (2014); Bieniasz, Anna Marek, The influence of working capital management on the food industry enterprises profitability, Contemporary Economics, 5, 4, pp. 68-81, (2011); undefined, (2017); Carbó, Santiago, Trade Credit, the Financial Crisis, and SME Access to Finance, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 48, 1, pp. 113-143, (2016); Chaddad, Fabio Ribas, Sources of firm performance differences in the US food economy, Journal of Agricultural Economics, 64, 2, pp. 382-404, (2013); Journal of Economics Business and Management, (2018); de Miguel, Alberto, Ownership structure and firm value: New evidence from Spain, Strategic Management Journal, 25, 12, pp. 1199-1207, (2004)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","0308597X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105582408"

This work presents the relationship between CEO personality traits and corporate social responsibility (CSR) and shows whether corporate governance (CG) practices mitigate or enhance this relationship. This study uses a sample of 420 firm-year-observations using a sample of European real estate firms indexed on Stoxx Europe 600 Index from 2010 to 2019. To test the developed hypotheses, feasible generalized least square (FGLS) regression is applied. The results show that increased confidence in CEOs is an important factor in determining corporate incentives to undertake social responsibility activities. In addition, it has been shown that effective corporate governance practices lead significantly to moderate CEO behavior with regard to corporate social responsibility sharing. Since corporate governance can have a significant impact on CEOs’ behavior in relation to corporate social responsibility, the author recommends firms to improve corporate governance in listed European real estate companies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo; Corporate Governance; Corporate Social Responsibility; European Real Estate Companies; Personality Traits","","","","","Abatecola, Gianpaolo, Reviewing cognitive distortions in managerial decision making: Toward an integrative co-evolutionary framework, Journal of Management Development, 37, 5, pp. 409-424, (2018); Aguilera, Ruth, Putting the s back in corporate social responsibility: A multilevel theory of social change in organizations, Academy of Management Review, 32, 3, pp. 836-863, (2007); Ajaz, Aiman, Delineating the influence of boardroom gender diversity on corporate social responsibility, financial performance, and reputation, Logforum, 16, 1, pp. 61-74, (2020); Aktas, Nihat, CEO Narcissism and the Takeover Process: From Private Initiation to Deal Completion, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 51, 1, pp. 113-137, (2016); Alam, Zinat S., Board Structure Mandates: Consequences for Director Location and Financial Reporting, Management Science, 64, 10, pp. 4735-4754, (2018); Al-Shammari, Marwan Ahmad, CEO narcissism and corporate social responsibility: Does CEO narcissism affect CSR focus?, Journal of Business Research, 104, pp. 106-117, (2019); Andreou, Panayiotis C., Valuation effects of overconfident CEOs on corporate diversification and refocusing decisions, Journal of Banking and Finance, 100, pp. 182-204, (2019); Econometrics of Panel Data, (1996); Beltratti, Andrea E., The complementarity between corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, 30, 3, pp. 373-386, (2005); Ben Mohamed, Ezzeddine, R&D investment–cash flow sensitivity under managerial optimism, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 14, pp. 1-4, (2017)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Retracted","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165743908"

The effect of family businesses is also examined as a moderator of the relationship between short-selling and firm value. Using panel data analysis of Chinese listed companies, this paper tests a total sample of 22,468 firm-year observations from the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2009 to 2019 by applying the PSM-DID method in order to mitigate self-selection and endogenous problems caused by the uniqueness of Chinese short selling mechanisms. The findings suggest that both deregulation and the propensity of short selling can improve the firm value. Our findings also established that family ownership weakens firm value with the availability of short-selling, which indicates that family businesses have long orientations and conduct better corporate governance practices than non-family business, as short-selling shows a weaker external governance effect on firm value creation by family businesses in China. A robust test of alternative measurements is conducted and validated. This study provides significant insights for policymakers to consider in order to further relax short-selling constraints, which can act as effective external governance for better firm value creation, especially for non-family businesses in developing countries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Family Ownership; Firm Value; Short-selling","","","","","Abrardi, Laura, Ownership and performance in the Italian stock exchange: the puzzle of family firms, Journal of Industrial and Business Economics, 47, 4, pp. 613-643, (2020); Aguiar-Díaz, Inmaculada, Ownership structure and financial performance of Spanish port service companies, Maritime Economics and Logistics, 22, 4, pp. 674-698, (2020); Brockman, Paul A., The impact of short-selling pressure on corporate employee relations, Journal of Corporate Finance, 64, (2020); Journal of International Accounting Research, (2018); Caliendo, Marco, Some practical guidance for the implementation of propensity score matching, Journal of Economic Surveys, 22, 1, pp. 31-72, (2008); Chen, Jun, Short selling, margin trading, and the incorporation of new information into prices, International Review of Financial Analysis, 44, pp. 1-17, (2016); Chen, Jun, The Impact of Margin-Trading and Short-Selling on Stock Price Efficiency—Evidence from the Fifth-Round Ban Lift in the Chinese Stock Market, Chinese Economy, 53, 3, pp. 265-284, (2020); Chen, Shenglan, Deregulation of short-selling constraints and cost of bank loans: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 64, (2020); Cheng, Qiang, Family firm research - A review, China Journal of Accounting Research, 7, 3, pp. 149-163, (2014); Cordeiro, James J., Board gender diversity and corporate environmental performance: The moderating role of family and dual-class majority ownership structures, Business Strategy and the Environment, 29, 3, pp. 1127-1144, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163193418"

The industrial sector is supposed to be a major cause of climate change problems that lead to global warming. Therefore, corporate social responsibility (CSR) with the help of corporate governance is an imperative approach to control these social prob-lems. Consequently, in the context of the organizational and management theory, agency theory, and the stakeholder theory, this study focuses on important factors of internal corporate governance such as chief executive officer (CEO) power, the board size, independence, ownership concentra-tion, managerial ownership, and audit quality for improving the profitability of firms. Moreover, this study considers corporate social responsibility as a controlling and moderating factor for firm performance and internal corporate governance. We employed ordinary least square (OLS) for en-dogeneity testing, fixed effect (FE), generalized method of moments (GMM), and feasible generalized least square (FGLS) on data of Pakistani firms for the period of 2010–2019. The results of this study demonstrate the following outcomes: firstly, all internal corporate governance factors are positively linked with firm performance; secondly, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the most valuable tool for improving profitability. Importantly, this study suggests that all internal corporate governance factors are positively linked with firm performance because of the interactive role of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study practically contributes to the literature by suggest-ing the imperative role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) for internal corporate governance, which may help to reduce climate and social problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Social Responsibility (csr), Internal Corporate Governance; Firm Performance; Manufacturing Firms; Corporate Social Responsibility; Firm Size; Governance Approach; Industrial Development; Manufacturing; Performance Assessment; Profitability; Stakeholder; Article; Climate; Generalized Method Of Moments; Human; Least Square Analysis; Management Theory; Pakistan; Social Problem; Social Responsibility; Theoretical Study; Industry; Organization; Organization And Management; Industry; Organizations; Ownership; Social Responsibility","corporate social responsibility; firm size; governance approach; industrial development; manufacturing; performance assessment; profitability; stakeholder; article; climate; generalized method of moments; human; least square analysis; management theory; Pakistan; social problem; social responsibility; theoretical study; industry; organization; organization and management; Industry; Organizations; Ownership; Social Responsibility","","","This research is funded by Hangzhou College of Commerce, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China.","Liao, Zhongju, Market Orientation and FIRMS' Environmental Innovation: The Moderating Role of Environmental Attitude, Business Strategy and the Environment, 27, 1, pp. 117-127, (2018); Song, Malin, Statistical analysis and combination forecasting of environmental efficiency and its influential factors since China entered the WTO: 2002-2010-2012, Journal of Cleaner Production, 42, pp. 42-51, (2013); Mohamed Adnan, Shayuti, The influence of culture and corporate governance on corporate social responsibility disclosure: A cross country analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 198, pp. 820-832, (2018); Contrafatto, Massimo, Understanding power-related strategies and initiatives: The case of the European Commission Green Paper on CSR, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal, 33, 3, pp. 559-587, (2020); Bhagat, Sanjai, Corporate governance and firm performance: The sequel, Journal of Corporate Finance, 58, pp. 142-168, (2019); Bhatt, Padmanabha Ramachandra, Corporate governance and firm performance in Malaysia, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 17, 5, pp. 896-912, (2017); Hutchinson, Marion R., Investment opportunity set, corporate governance practices and firm performance, Journal of Corporate Finance, 10, 4, pp. 595-614, (2004); Prevost, Andrew K., Determinants of board composition in New Zealand: A simultaneous equations approach, Journal of Empirical Finance, 9, 4, pp. 373-397, (2002); Jo, Hoje, Corporate Governance and Firm Value: The Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility, Journal of Business Ethics, 103, 3, pp. 351-383, (2011); Wu, Shinong, CEO power, disclosure quality and the variability of firm performance: Evidence from China, Nankai Business Review International, 2, 1, pp. 79-97, (2011)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","16604601; 16617827","","","34071620","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106605171"

We focus on high-tech entrepreneurial ventures because these are the firms that jolts affect most; in so doing, we also advance the understanding of DCs in the entrepreneurship field. We argue that, in the aftermath of an environmental jolt, the high-tech entrepreneurial ventures that use internationalization and new product development capabilities to modify their resource configuration and regain environmental fit enjoy better performance. Econometric estimates on a sample of 340 Italian high-tech entrepreneurial ventures confronting the consequences of the global economic crisis that began in 2008 confirm that separately using these two DCs has a positive performance effect. This effect is stronger for relatively smaller ventures. Interestingly, despite synergies should arise from the combined use of the two DCs, we do not detect any superadditive effects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Capabilities; Entrepreneurial Ventures; Environmental Jolt; Firm Performance; Internationalization Capability; New Product Development Capability; Product Development; Dynamic Capabilities; Environmental Jolt; Global Economic Crisis; New Product Development; On Dynamics; Performance Effect; Resource Configurations; Superadditive; Enterprise Resource Management; Adaptive Management; Crisis Management; Econometrics; Economic Instability; Entrepreneur; High Technology Industry; Industrial Performance; Performance Assessment; Italy","Product development; Dynamic capabilities; Environmental jolt; Global economic crisis; New product development; ON dynamics; Performance effect; Resource configurations; Superadditive; Enterprise resource management; adaptive management; crisis management; econometrics; economic instability; entrepreneur; high technology industry; industrial performance; performance assessment; Italy","","","This work was supported by RISIS, project funded by the European Union's Horizon2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant number 824091 .","Ahuja, Gautam, Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 6-7, pp. 521-543, (2001); Angrist, Joshua D., Identification of Causal Effects Using Instrumental Variables, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 91, 434, pp. 444-455, (1996); Archibugi, Daniele, Economic crisis and innovation: Is destruction prevailing over accumulation?, Research Policy, 42, 2, pp. 303-314, (2013); Arend, Richard J., Entrepreneurship and dynamic capabilities: How firm age and size affect the 'capability enhancement-SME performance' relationship, Small Business Economics, 42, 1, pp. 33-57, (2014); Barker, Vincent L., Strategic change in the turnaround process: Theory and empirical evidence, Strategic Management Journal, 18, 1, pp. 13-38, (1997); Barreto, Ilídio, Dynamic Capabilities: A review of past research and an agenda for the future, Journal of Management, 36, 1, pp. 256-280, (2010); Bartz, Wiebke, Flexible or fragile?

The study also examines whether the chief executive officer’s (CEO) characteristics influence the choice of an assurance service provider. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses descriptive statistics, ordinary least square and probit regression to examine the 800 firm-year observations for the period 2010–2019 and with the Indian stock market as a testing ground. Findings: The study shows that the engagement of assurance service providers reduces financial performance (stock price returns and Tobin’s q). The study also shows that consulting firms and auditing firms improve the social performance disclosure of the firm in an emerging economy. However, consulting firms outweigh auditing firms in improving social performance disclosure. Also, the implementation of mandatory reporting may slightly impede instead of an increase in social performance disclosure in an emerging economy. The study also shows that ageing CEOs prefer consulting firms over auditing firms in assurance service provision. Finally, the study shows that an extended stay in office by a CEO improves the choice of consulting firms, but the effect has a near-neutral significance. Originality/value: The choice of CEO characteristics as an independent variable adds to the factors or drivers that cause the choice of an assurance service provider in an emerging economy.

Results show that the volatility index is the strongest, followed by the S&P 500 stock index, the US dollar index, the CRB index, the Trade index, and the Brent crude oil index. However, the US dollar index has the most significant effect of using the index values of currency ETNs, followed by the S&P 500 stock index, volatility index, Brent crude oil index, the CRB index, and Trade index. This study applies four types of the artificial neural network model, namely, back-propagation neural network (BPN), recurrent neural network (RNN), time-delay recurrent neural network (TDRNN), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to capture the nonlinear tendencies of ETNs for better forecasting accuracy. The paper finds that the RNN and RBFNN models have stronger predictive power among the models, and provides the highest forecasting accuracy for the majority of the currency ETNs. However, the RNN model consistently shows that the low grey relational grades (GRG) variables have the strongest influence on the ETN returns, compared with combining all and high GRG variables. These findings suggest that fund managers and traders can potentially rely on both RNN and RBFNN models, particularly the former, in their applications in financial time-series modeling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Networks; Currency Etns; Grey Relational Analysis","","","","","Ajith, Abraham, Hybrid intelligent systems for stock market analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2074, pp. 337-345, (2001); Andreou, Andreas S., Exchange-Rates Forecasting: A Hybrid Algorithm Based on Genetically Optimized Adaptive Neural Networks, Computational Economics, 20, 3, pp. 191-210, (2002); Dogus Universitesi Dergisi, (2007); Internationaljournaloffinance, (2009); Borş, Adrian G., Minimal topology for a radial basis functions neural network for pattern classification, Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal, 4, 3, pp. 173-188, (1994); Borş, Adrian G., Median radial basis function neural network, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 7, 6, pp. 1351-1364, (1996); Complex Systems, (1988); Brown, Gregory W., Investor sentiment and the near-term stock market, Journal of Empirical Finance, 11, 1, pp. 1-27, (2004); Theory and Practice of Artificial Neural Network, (2003); Journal of Engineering Valuation and Cost Analysis, (1999)","","De Gruyter Open Ltd","","","","","","10811826; 15583708","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081601941"

The attention is not only to evaluate the efficiency but also to identify the variable wise inefficiencies incorporating the quality of the portfolio. Design/methodology/approach: The paper assessed MFI efficiency using three different methods of treatment of undesirable output to portray the significant difference. It also has used an advanced methodological model, i.e. weighted Russell directional distance model (WRDDM), under the non-radial assumption that allowed us to find the variable-wise inefficiency contribution. The study also investigated the efficiency differences concerning ownership, including all sizes of MFIs. Findings: The study findings evidence the fall in efficiency score as NPL integrated, and it is found to be statistically significant. In the context of inefficiency assessment, among all input and output variables, total employees and operating expenses, portfolio quality inefficiencies are the leading causes of MFI inefficiencies. Undesirable output inefficiency accounts for almost one-third part of the total inefficiencies and remaining due to input inefficiencies. It is significant to draw attention that there is no improvement in undesirable output inefficiency. By contrast, input inefficiencies retained gains for two years and gradually showed a decreasing trend throughout 2015–2017. Research limitations/implications: The authors have used balanced panel data of 72 Indian MFIs for five years' period from 2013–2017 whose complete data were available in the Microfinance Information Exchange. Practical implications: The paper has focused on identifying the inefficiencies that are needed to be focused on to attain efficiency. It could provide vital information to the managers, policymakers in identifying the causes of inefficiencies, which is crucial to improve for long-term sustainability. It will be a roadmap for benchmarking, strategy building and policy-making processes. Social implications: The findings of the study help in finding the benchmarking information for the inefficient decision-making units to identify the target units that need particular attention to focus. These practices could give a positive outcome, not only for institutions but also for the MFI clients. Originality/value: The study provides an insight in to variable-wise inefficiency measurement using advanced model WRDDM in Indian context MFIs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dea; India; Inefficiency Assessment; Microfinance; Non-performing Loans; Undesirable Output; Wrddm","","","","We thank anonymous referees for providing comments and help in improving the presentation of this paper.","Abate, Gashaw Tadesse, Cost-efficiency and outreach of microfinance institutions: Trade-offs and the role of ownership, Journal of International Development, 26, 6, pp. 923-932, (2014); Al-Awlaqi, Mohammed Ali, Financial and social efficiency in the Yemen microfinance institutions: A Hicks–Moorsteen TFP index analysis, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 12, 3, pp. 322-345, (2019); ANNIM, SAMUEL KOBINA, Microfinance efficiency: Trade-offs and complementarities between the objectives of microfinance institutions and their performance perspectives, European Journal of Development Research, 24, 5, pp. 788-807, (2012); Arora, Nitin, Non-performing assets and technical efficiency of Indian banks: a meta-frontier analysis, Benchmarking, 25, 7, pp. 2105-2125, (2018); Athanassopoulos, Antreas D., Service quality and operating efficiency synergies for management control in the provision of financial services: Evidence from Greek bank branches, European Journal of Operational Research, 98, 2, pp. 300-313, (1997); Atmadja, Adwin Surja, Microfinance and microenterprise performance in Indonesia: an extended and updated survey, International Journal of Social Economics, 45, 6, pp. 957-972, (2018); Ayayi, Ayi Gavriel, Better with age?

In order to assess the intergroup relationships, basic correlation relationships were compared and a nonparametric test of variance was performed. The period under study covered the years 2015–2019. The conducted research evaluates groups of companies that dedicated their activity to a particular energy intra-industry division under numerous regulations in Europe. The study contributes to assessing the level of risk among energy listed companies in European capital markets based on capital structure valuation. The study results underline the role of the cost of equity financing, which was twice as high as the cost of debt. The highest WACC was related to the Beta indicator that also expressed the political and regulatory risk over the investigated period. Across debt cost analysis, the role of effective tax rate decreased the level of WACC. The highest level of WACC was noticed among uranium and integrated oil and gas companies.

SMEs are the main drivers to strengthen society in sustaining economic growth and development. Governments provide various support programs to improve their industrial power and to increase the number of enterprises in the market. The enterprises must be assessed and suitable funds should be provided to those in need, to achieve an effective support program in the most efficient way.This requires implementing an assessment methodology based on a predefined set of scientific criteria. The current literature is comprehensive enough to assess the healthiness of the enterprises concerning strategic, technologic, financial as well as intellectual competencies but on the other hand, it lacks of an assessment model. This study aims to introduce a general framework for sustaining an effective assessment methodology for SMEs to eliminate this gap. The proposed model measures five different types of competencies such as Technological Competency, Strategic Competency, Financial Competency, Intellectual Competency, R&D and Innovation Competency. These competencies are to put forth the conditions in which the enterprises are running accurately. A real-life case study is conducted to ensure the baseline of the model to be implemented.

Based on the underpinning of the conceptual framework developed by a combination of fourteen femininity theories, the current study investigates women’s induction in top management and its impact on a firm’s financial behavior. We collected data from annual reports of 60 non-financial firms listed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) for 2013–2019. The study uses the return of assets (ROA), firm’s stability (FSTB), and risk-taking behavior (RTB) as dependent variables. Meanwhile, board gender diversity (BGD), female CEO (FCEO), female director-general (FDG), and female in audit committee (FIAC) are taken as independent variables. A multiple regression diagnostics approach is applied to analyze the data. The study reveals the positive impact of BGD on ROA and FSTB. However, this effect is adverse to RTB. The FIAC shows a positive (negative) impact on ROA (RTB).

Specifically, it synthesizes, appraises, and extends current knowledge on the (a) theoretical (i.e., economic, accounting/corporate governance, sociological and socio-psychological) perspectives and (b) empirical evidence of the observable and less visible attributes at both the individual and committee levels and their link with a wide range (financial/non-financial) of corporate outcomes. Using the systematic literature review method, 304 articles from 59 journals in the fields of accounting and finance that were published between January 1992 and December 2018 are reviewed. The main findings are as follows. First and theoretically, agency theory is the most dominant applied theory/studies with no application of theory at all (descriptive), while the application of integrated theoretical frameworks is lacking in the reviewed articles. Secondly, the existing empirical evidence focusses excessively on (a) monitoring instead of advisory committees and (b) observable rather than less visible committee attributes. Thirdly, scarcity of cross-country studies along with methodological limitations relating to measurement inconsistencies, insufficiency of variables, and dominance of quantitative studies, among others, are identified. Finally, promising future research avenues are outlined. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Advisory And Monitoring Roles; Corporate Board Subcommittees; Corporate Governance; Corporate Outcomes","","","","We would like to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive and helpful comments, which have helped us in improving the quality of this paper.

We use a data set of 4446 small- and medium-sized firms extracted from Funderbeam and logit regression models to test five hypotheses about internationalisation. Exploring a firm’s digital presence indicates that the number of social media followers is a better indicator of internationalisation than website traffic, highlighting the importance of engagement signals in the digital space. Investment signals such as the time and size of funding are also positively related to internationalisation but surprisingly, not the number of investors, suggesting that more focused investment strategies work better in the international context. To complement our international network signalling approach, controlling for firm factors such as age and size and environmental factors such as competition and industry provides a more detailed analysis. Our contribution lies in extending signalling theory in the context of international networks using a novel and extensive data set. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Presence; Internationalisation; Investment Network; Signalling Theory; Small Firms","","","","","Alford, Philip, Marketing technology for adoption by small business, Service Industries Journal, 35, 11-12, pp. 655-669, (2015); Reuer, Jeffrey J., Absolute and relative resources as determinants of international acquisitions, Strategic Management Journal, 23, 2, pp. 119-134, (2002); Anderson, Alistair R., The articulation of social capital in entrepreneurial networks: A glue or a lubricant?, Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 14, 3, pp. 193-210, (2002); Anderson, Alistair R., Network practices and entrepreneurial growth, Scandinavian Journal of Management, 26, 2, pp. 121-133, (2010); Andersson, Svante, International new ventures: Rapid internationalization across different industry contexts, European Business Review, 26, 5, pp. 390-405, (2014); Arenius, Pia, Rapid internationalisation enabled by the Internet: The case of a knowledge intensive company, Journal of International Entrepreneurship, 3, 4, pp. 279-290, (2005); Financial Management, (1986); Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction, (1995); Autio, Erkko, Digital affordances, spatial affordances, and the genesis of entrepreneurial ecosystems, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 12, 1, pp. 72-95, (2018); Social Foundations of Thought and Action A Social Cognitive Theory, (1986)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","02662426","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092155602"

Mergers have been constantly a subject of debate and analysis over the past decades. Thus, it is a matter of great interest to analyze merger activities during economic crisis periods, as it was in Greece recently. This paper explores the accounting performance of Greek listed companies after mergers in 2009–2015, the economic crisis period in Greece. Thus, all mergers of listed companies during the above period are initially examined through several financial ratios from financial statements for one year before and after the merger. The analysis of Greek listed companies that comprise the final sample is performed with several regression models. The study provides positive and statistically significant results for mergers, in the sense that the period of crisis that the merger took place is positively correlated with several performance measures. Regarding the industry relatedness, the study provides evidence that conglomerate mergers have more positive impact to the improvement of the companies’ profitability than non-conglomerate mergers. Last, for the merger events that take place far from the climax of the economic crisis, the profitability of merged companies is increased. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Performance; Economic Crisi; Financial Statements; Greece; Merger; Ratios","","","","","Social Science Research Network, (2015); Aggarwal, Puja, Impact of Mergers and Acquisitions on Accounting-based Performance of Acquiring Firms in India, Global Business Review, 23, 1, pp. 218-236, (2022); Agyei-Boapeah, Henry, Easing financing and M&A investment constraints: The role of corporate industrial diversification, Annals of Economics and Finance, 18, 2, pp. 277-290, (2017); Middle East Journal of Scientific Research, (2014); Alcalde Fradejas, Nuria, The characteristics of takeover targets: The Spanish experience 1991-1997, Journal of Management and Governance, 7, 1, pp. 1-26, (2003); Alexandrou, George, Mergers and acquisitions in shipping, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 61, pp. 212-234, (2014); International Journal of Management Business Studies, (2016); Managing Global Transitions, (2014); Berrioategortua, Joaquín Sanz, Does company performance improve after m&a?

According to the resource‐based view (RBV), absorptive capacity and buffer inventory are organizational capabilities and resources to create sustainable competitive advantages. Yet, the resource orchestration perspective (ROP) of the RBV emphasizes that firms need to develop a new capability to orchestrate and deploy their existing capabilities and resources. From an organizational learning perspective, firms with the low‐level release of toxic chemicals have established a structured system and systematic organizational routines, strengthening their learning capabilities to share and use internal and external information across functional areas for continuous improvements. This study explores and seeks to understand toxic emissions through systematic operational routines as an organizational mechanism. These routines orchestrate and deploy the firm‐specific absorptive capacity and buffer inventory to generate a sustainable competitive advantage. We examine the impacts of the absorptive capacity and buffer inventory on firm value in terms of Tobin’s Q, respectively. We also explore how such impacts are moderated by toxic emissions. Our results show that the absorptive capacity significantly enhances the market value of firms. However, the relationship between the buffer inventory and firm value is insignificant. Our additional analyses indicate that the impacts of the absorptive capacity and buffer inventory on the firm value are both significantly positive when firms release low toxic chemicals. Our results further suggest that firms can maximize their market value with a high absorptive capacity, high buffer inventory, and low toxic emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Absorptive Capacity; Buffer Inventory; Firm Value; Toxic Emissions; Cyanide; Lead; Mercury; Nitrate; Sodium Nitrite; Cyanide; Dioxin; Lead; Mercury; Nitrate; Sodium Nitrite; Toxic Substance; Competitiveness; Emission Inventory; Environmental Economics; Industrial Emission; Industrial Performance; Organizational Framework; Performance Assessment; Sustainability; Valuation; Adsorption Kinetics; Article; Carbon Footprint; Energy Conservation; Energy Resource; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Management; Environmental Sustainability; Human; Natural Resource","cyanide; dioxin; lead; mercury; nitrate; sodium nitrite; toxic substance; competitiveness; emission inventory; environmental economics; industrial emission; industrial performance; organizational framework; performance assessment; sustainability; valuation; adsorption kinetics; Article; carbon footprint; energy conservation; energy resource; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental sustainability; human; natural resource","","cyanide, 57-12-5; lead, 7439-92-1, 13966-28-4; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; nitrate, 14797-55-8; sodium nitrite, 7632-00-0","","Chan, Hing Kai, The moderating effect of environmental dynamism on green product innovation and performance, International Journal of Production Economics, 181, pp. 384-391, (2016); Sroufe, Robert P., Effects of environmental management systems on environmental management practices and operations, Production and Operations Management, 12, 3, pp. 416-431, (2003); Lo, Chris Kwan Yu, The impact of environmental management systems on financial performance in fashion and textiles industries, International Journal of Production Economics, 135, 2, pp. 561-567, (2012); Rosen, Marc A., Sustainable manufacturing and design: Concepts, practices and needs, Sustainability (Switzerland), 4, 2, pp. 154-174, (2012); Claver-Cortés, Enrique, Environmental management and firm performance: A case study, Journal of Environmental Management, 84, 4, pp. 606-619, (2007); Prajogo, Daniel I., Environmental Audits and Third Party Certification of Management Practices: Firms’ Motives, Audit Orientations, and Satisfaction with Certification, International Journal of Auditing, 20, 2, pp. 202-210, (2016); Cucchiella, Federica, The management of greenhouse gas emissions and its effects on firm performance, Journal of Cleaner Production, 167, pp. 1387-1400, (2017); Hart, Stuart L., Does it pay to be green?

We constantly observe a negative association between them: After being exposed to social interaction, a trader’s odds ratio to sell a paper gain stock decreases by 9% to 10%, depending on different model settings. We then test the mechanisms of social interaction by decomposing it into three channels: learning intensity (willingness to learn), learning quality (information advantage through learning), and public scrutinization (exposure of trading outcome to others). We find that all three channels contribute to a smaller disposition effect. Specifically, our findings support the claim that public scrutinization promotes self-consciousness and reduces disposition effect. Also, our results extend previous studies on investors’ information advantage by suggesting that it could also help to mitigate the disposition effect through the reduction of uncertainty.

Among undesirable impacts, emphasis must be put on the risk of information security (ISec) breaches, as they pose a potential threat to businesses there. Especially for publicly traded firms, they could create a long-lasting influence on their financial performance and, thus, stock investors’ confidence. Following the efficient market hypothesis’s footsteps, previous studies have examined only the short-run impact on investors’ confidence ensuing to ISec breach announcements. Therefore, this study investigates the long-run impact of ISec breach announcements on investors’ confidence. Based on a sample of 73 ISec breach announcements during 2011–2019, this paper examines the impact on investors’ confidence, as demonstrated by long-run abnormal returns and equity risk of those firms. Using a one-to-one matched sampling approach, each firm’s performance is analyzed with its control firm over eighteen months, starting six months before the announcement, through twelve months after the announcement. Firms experienced a significant negative abnormal return of 15% to 18% during the twelve months following the breach announcement. In comparison, equity risk increased by 11% within six months before and after an announcement. This study can help investors, managers, and researchers better understand a long-term relationship between ISec breaches and investor confidence in the context of efficient market hypothesis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficient Market Hypotheses; Equity Risk; Long-run Abnormal Returns; Sustainable Development Goals (sdgs); Business; Firm Size; Hypothesis Testing; Information And Communication Technology; Sustainable Development; Sustainable Development Goal","business; firm size; hypothesis testing; information and communication technology; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal","","","Funding: This work was funded by the Department of Management and Humanities, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), and Faculty of Business and Economics, Universitas Islam Indonesia (UII), under grant cost center 015MEO-114.

Three multivariate conditional volatility models, namely constant conditional correlation (CCC), dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) and diagonal BEKK are applied. Using the conditional covariance and variance from the MGARCH estimates, the optimal hedge ratios (OHRs) are computed. The results of this study show that the volatility spillover exists between the returns of crude oil futures and tyre equity. However, for tyre equities, the best cross hedge is tyre equity futures rather than crude futures.

We have calculated the productivity growth of MFIs over its two components, such as catch up effect and frontier shift effect by measuring the variation in efficiency and technology, respectively. The study is based on data of 72 Indian MFIs over five years from 2013-2017. We have employed a directional distance function (DDF) model to compute the Malmquist Luenberger productivity index (MLPI), output-oriented with undesirable output assuming a constant return to scale. The study also attempted to find a significant difference between two methodologies, i.e., Malmquist productivity index (MPI) and MLPI, to show the effect of NPL through testing of hypothesis. Furthermore we have classified the MFIs into four groups using a categorisation rule to infer the relationship between productivity growth, technical changes (TC), and efficiency change (EC) components to give noteworthy economic information for benchmarking and policymaking. The findings indicated that rather than the technological change component, the efficiency changes are contributing more to the productivity growth of MFIs. It implies that Indian MFIs need to strengthen more technically, to enhance their productivity and efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ddf; Dea; Directional Distance Function; Malmquist Luenberger Productivity Index; Microfinance; Mlpi; Productivity Growth; Undesirable Output","","","","","Ben Abdelkader, Ines, Performance of microfinance institutions in the MENA region: a comparative analysis, International Journal of Social Economics, 46, 1, pp. 47-65, (2019); Azad, Md Abul Kalam, Efficiency analysis of major microfinance institutions in Bangladesh: a Malmquist index approach, Quality and Quantity, 50, 4, pp. 1525-1537, (2016); Al-Awlaqi, Mohammed Ali, Financial and social efficiency in the Yemen microfinance institutions: A Hicks–Moorsteen TFP index analysis, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 12, 3, pp. 322-345, (2019); Ambarkhane, Dilip Dinkar, Measuring total factor productivity change of microfinance institutions in India using Malmquist productivity index, Indian Growth and Development Review, 12, 1, pp. 105-130, (2019); Amirteimoori, Alireza, A euclidean distance-based measure of efficiency in data envelopment analysis, Optimization, 59, 7, pp. 985-996, (2010); ANNIM, SAMUEL KOBINA, Microfinance efficiency: Trade-offs and complementarities between the objectives of microfinance institutions and their performance perspectives, European Journal of Development Research, 24, 5, pp. 788-807, (2012); Ayayi, Ayi Gavriel, Better with age?

The proposed model explains how, the positive association between CSR and firm performance relationship, established on the basis of the stakeholder and corporate citizenship theories, can be further strengthened (effective monitoring hypothesis) or weakened (myopic institutions theory) by the presence of institutional investors in the firm’s ownership structure and corporate governance mechanism (agency theory). The study tested the proposed model on the unbalanced sample of 327 non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX). The study concludes that, based on the agency theory, institutional investors (as a homogeneous group) positively moderates the CSR and firm performance relationship. However, agency theory failed to explain the negative moderation of short term investment horizon institutional investors and firm performance.

If the EMH is invalid, the research further forecasts short-term stock prices by applying autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model using daily price data from 2010 to 2018. Findings: The research confirms that a weak form of EMH is not valid in the US SRI and SCI. The historical data can predict short-term future price movements by using technical ARIMA model.

The study aims to investigate the effect of bank recapitalization approaches such as mergers and acquisitions, equity issues and interventions (bailouts) on the performance of the Nigerian banking sector. The notion that bank recapitalization heats up has been discussed and still does not present a proper consensus in the available literature. Therefore, topics that involve research on the strategies of recapitalization and their effects on bank performance are of interest in the literature. A survey method was used to gather data and the responses received from the regional, branch and senior managers in the banking sector were used to analyse and check to see if bank recapitalization actually affects the performance of the banking sector. Structural equation modelling (SEM) results indicated that bank recapitalization is positively related to bank performance. The results further revealed that all the recapitalization approaches have a positive and significant effect on bank performance. Thus, the use of recapitalization mechanisms for undercapitalized banks during crises or normal times is highly encouraged for sustainability and in the banking sector, as the backbone of the economy of any nation.

We also investigate the effect of CEOs’ psychological attributes of overconfidence on R&D investment and the moderating effect between the types of CEOs and R&D investment. Methods: We obtained data on Chinese A-share firms from China Stock Exchange and Accounting Research from 2010 to 2018 for analysis. Then, we used the ordinary least squares model for regression results; moreover, the Tobit regression, GMM and firm fixed effect model are applied to check the robustness of the results. Results: Family CEOs with actual control rights are more open to R&D investment, whereas those without actual control rights exhibit negative behavior. The study found that non-family CEOs exhibit insignificant results and negative predicted signs toward R&D investment. Moreover, the results show that overconfident CEOs are more inclined to amplify innovation. Furthermore, results on the moderating effects of CEO psychological attribute of overconfidence indicate that the CEO overconfidence mitigates the negative relationship between family CEOs with actual control rights and R&D investment. However, no moderating effect is found between family CEOs without actual control and R&D investment. The CEO psychological attribute behavior is positive between non-family CEOs and R&D investment. Discussion: This novel study explores the behavioral effect of different types of family firm CEOs on R&D investment. This study will assist corporate board members to make more informed decisions about retaining (or bringing back) family CEOs (with or without actual control rights) or hiring non-family CEOs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Overconfidence; Ceos Types; Family Firms; R&d; Article; China; Human; Investment; Least Square Analysis","article; China; human; investment; least square analysis","","","","Sitthipongpanich, Thitima, Do CEO and board characteristics matter?

By using a sample of 136 non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange over the period of 2015-2019, we find that family ownership has a positive and significant impact on CEO compensation. The finding regarding foreign ownership is contrary to expectations, with a higher foreign ownership reflecting a higher CEO compensation. Overall, these results imply that the ownership structure of Jordanian companies exerts a significant influence on the CEO pay setting process. However, government ownership has no relationship with CEO compensation. This indicates that government ownership is ineffective in determining CEO compensation. We further find that firm size is positively related to CEO compensation, indicating that larger companies have more ability to generate high internal funding, and can afford to pay higher compensation to quality managerial talent. In contrast, the effects of firm age and liquidity are not at significant levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency Theory; Ceo Compensation; Family Ownership; Foreign Ownership; Government Ownership; Jordan; Stewardship Theory","","","","","International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2014); Aggarwal, Rajesh K., The other side of the trade-off: The impact of risk on executive compensation, Journal of Political Economy, 107, 1, pp. 65-105, (1999); Journal of Business and Management, (2015); International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences, (2020); Alhababsah, Salem, Ownership structure and audit quality: An empirical analysis considering ownership types in Jordan, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 35, pp. 71-84, (2019); Alhusban, Ahmad Abed Alla, The regulatory structure and governance of forensic accountancy in the emerging market: Challenges and opportunities, Journal of Governance and Regulation, 9, 4, pp. 149-161, (2020); Accounting and Finance Research, (2020); Amewu, Godfred, Mergers, executive compensation and firm performance: The case of Africa, Managerial and Decision Economics, 42, 2, pp. 407-436, (2021); Anderson, Ronald C., Founding-Family Ownership and Firm Performance: Evidence from the S&P 500, Journal of Finance, 58, 3, pp. 1301-1327, (2003); Baixauli-Soler, Juan Samuel, Executive compensation and corporate governance in Spanish listed firms: a principal–principal perspective, Review of Managerial Science, 9, 1, pp. 115-140, (2015)","","Asian Economic and Social Society","","","","","","23052147; 22226737","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106513587"

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an international data set of 1,817 firm-year observations from 545 large companies in 20 countries across Asia, America and Europe, and the fixed-effects estimation method. Findings: The direct effect of IDs alone on profitability is statistically insignificant; however, the synergic effect of IDs and CSR on profitability becomes significantly positive when firms disclose CSR information. Practical implications: The profitability is partially sourced from the synergy of IDs and stakeholders through CSR. IDs may use CSR disclosure to win stakeholders’ goodwill. This goodwill will likely be transformed into profitability. The empirical results indicate that there should be more need for IDs’ engagement in CSR projects as the resources of IDs combined with external stakeholders can be of important value to firms. Originality/value: This paper reveals the underlying mechanism that firm-idiosyncratic value is formed using a combination of ID resources and stakeholders through CSR. This research extends the literature of IDs’ efficiency and effectiveness and confirms the agency theory and resource dependence theory. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Firm Performance; Independent Directors; Profitability","","","","The author would like to thank Professor Gerhard Kling and Dr Hanh S.T.

This study used a modified VAIC model to measure IC to compose a 4-component variable including human capital, structural capital, relational capital, and innovation capital. The data were collected from VCS-backed and listed firms in China during 2014 to 2018 applying the pooled OLS model for hypotheses test, Generalized Method of Moments (GMMsTh to reduce endogeneity and unobserved factor control, and also return on equity (ROETh instead of ROA for the robustness test. Empirical results showed that IC and its components can improve PFP for VCS-backed firms in China; in detail, IC showed greater impact on performance of firms invested by foreign lead investors than in private or government VCS, specially reflected in the impact of innovation capital on PFP. Furthermore, IC showed weaker impact on PFP of mixed VCS-backed firms compared to pure VCS-backed firms and showed diminished effect on higher VCS member heterogeneity mainly reflected in the impact of relational capital on firm performance. These findings propose a new way of combining IC and VC to improve firm performance and are beneficial to theoretical development of IC and VC as well as a perspective for VC firm managers to choose suitable partners prior to join a VCS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Integrated Circuits; Investments; Knowledge Management; Method Of Moments; Generalized Method Of Moments; Innovation Capital; Intellectual Capital; Moderating Effect; Relational Capital; Return On Equity; Robustness Tests; Theoretical Development; Thorium Compounds","Integrated circuits; Investments; Knowledge management; Method of moments; Generalized method of moments; Innovation capital; Intellectual capital; Moderating effect; Relational capital; Return on equity; Robustness tests; Theoretical development; Thorium compounds","","","","Sardo, Filipe, Intellectual capital, growth opportunities, and financial performance in European firms: Dynamic panel data analysis, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 19, 4, pp. 747-767, (2018); Xu, Jian, Intellectual capital, technological innovation and firm performance: Evidence from China's manufacturing sector, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 19, (2019); Zhu, Weidong, How Intellectual Capital Combination Method Can Improve Corporate Performance in China's Information Technology Industry, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 4824-4837, (2020); Mobilizing Invisible Assets, (1987); Nahapiet, Janine E., Social capital, intellectual capital, and the organizational advantage, Academy of Management Review, 23, 2, pp. 242-266, (1998); Youndt, Mark A., Intellectual Capital Profiles: An Examination of Investments and Returns, Journal of Management Studies, 41, 2, pp. 335-361, (2004); International Journal of Business and Management, (2011); Maditinos, Dimitrios I., The impact of intellectual capital on firms' market value and financial performance, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 12, 1, pp. 132-151, (2011); Tseng, Chunyao, Intellectual capital and corporate value in an emerging economy: Empirical study of Taiwanese manufacturers, R and D Management, 35, 2, pp. 187-201, (2005); Bayraktaroglu, Ayse Elvan, Intellectual capital and firm performance: an extended VAIC model, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 20, 3, pp. 406-425, (2019)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","10990526; 10762787","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104483482"

The ownership structure is examined from a corporate governance theoretical perspective in order to evaluate the impacts of managerial, institutional, and family ownership on the dividend’s initiation decision of IPO firms. This study employs a quantitative pooled cross-section of 372 Malaysian IPO companies active during the period of 2002–2013. The number of firms that went public each year varies, thus the pooled cross-section data takes place in this case rather than the panel data. The logistic model was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results revealed that the presence of institutional investors in the ownership structure make it more likely for IPO firms to initiate dividends. On the contrary, the presence of a family ownership structure in IPO companies as the controlling shareholder makes these companies less probable to initiate dividends. Managerial ownership was found to have no effect on the decision of initiating dividends by IPO firms. The findings of this study suggest that the existence of institutional and family ownerships are agency cost mitigators, as these ownership types could prompt IPOs firms to initiate dividends to overcome the agency conflicts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dividends Initiation; Family Ownership; Institutional Ownership; Ipos Firms; Managerial Ownership","","","","","Agrawal, Anup, The dividend policies of all‐equity firms: A direct test of the free cash flow theory, Managerial and Decision Economics, 15, 2, pp. 139-148, (1994); Ahmad-Zaluki, Nurwati Ashikkin, IPO pricing in Malaysia: An analysis of REITs and non-REITs, International Journal of Economics and Management, 5, 2, pp. 319-332, (2011); Capital Market Review, (2005); International Review of Business Research Papers, (2012); Al-Malkawi, Husam Aldin Nizar, Determinants of Corporate Dividend Policy in Jordan: An Application of the Tobit Model, Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences, 23, 2, pp. 44-70, (2007); Ali, Ashiq, Corporate disclosures by family firms, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 44, 1-2, pp. 238-286, (2007); Allen, Franklin, A theory of dividends based on tax clienteles, Journal of Finance, 55, 6, pp. 2499-2536, (2000); Asian Business and Management Conference Official Conference Proceedings, (2012); Baker, Malcolm P., A catering theory of dividends, Journal of Finance, 59, 3, pp. 1125-1165, (2004); Did Erisa S Prudent Man Rule Change the Pricing of Dividend Omitting Firms, (1998)","","Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA)","","","","","","22884645; 22884637","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104058821"

Secondly, to examine the co-movements between the three monetary systems using wavelet coherence analysis. The findings indicate that an investor with momentum strategy can consider investing in Bitcoin and Gold market, while the contrarian investment strategy is more advisable for the fiat money market during crisis period. Furthermore, the wavelet coherence analysis indicates that Bitcoin currency is the most leading monetary system during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, followed by gold. However, US dollar mostly leads Bitcoin during non-crisis periods, while Gold is found to lead the US dollar throughout the sample period of the study. This suggests that the cryptocurrency system or gold standard should be considered as the alternative monetary system for better economic stability specially during the crisis period. Moreover, Bitcoin and gold had an anti-phase correlation before the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, which implies better benefits of hedging in the non-crisis period, while during a crisis they are moving together across different horizons. In contrast, Bitcoin and Fiat Money are strongly correlated during non-crisis periods, while during covide-19 pandemic crisis the correlation is statistically insignificant. Overall, the outcomes offer significant guidance for policymakers in understanding which monetary system leads to better economic stability during the crisis period and provides many implications for market players such hedging and Diversification investments strategy in forex markets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; Covid-19 Pandemic; Fait Money; Gold; Momentum And Contrarian Investment Strategy; Wavelet Coherence Analysis","","","","","Alareeni, Bahaaeddin Ahmed, Does corporate governance influence earnings management in listed companies in Bahrain Bourse?, Journal of Asia Business Studies, 12, 4, pp. 551-570, (2018); International Journal of Business Ethics and Governance, (2018); AlKhazali, Osamah M., The impact of positive and negative macroeconomic news surprises: Gold versus Bitcoin, Economics Bulletin, 38, 1, pp. 373-382, (2018); International Journal of Business Ethics and Governance, (2018); Hamed Al-Yahyaee, Khamis Hamed, Efficiency, multifractality, and the long-memory property of the Bitcoin market: A comparative analysis with stock, currency, and gold markets, Finance Research Letters, 27, pp. 228-234, (2018); Andrieş, Alin Marius, The relationship between exchange rates and interest rates in a small open emerging economy: The case of Romania, Economic Modelling, 67, pp. 261-274, (2017); Balcilar, Mehmet, Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility?

Guided by institutional theory, we focus on two important questions: (a) are the antecedents of restructuring common across downsizing and upsizing? and (b) are the performance consequences of such restructuring related to prior firm performance? To answer these questions, we use primary data from companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange over a 37-year period (1980-2016). Our results suggest that six key antecedents play a prominent role in both downsizing and upsizing, although they differ in magnitude and direction in how they affect each form of restructuring. However, in both instances they reflect efficiency considerations (company performance and managerial foresight), as well as institutional forces (the economy, political uncertainty, industry, and technology), just as neo-institutional theory suggests. In addition, prior performance plays a central role in restructuring decisions, in both the upsizing and downsizing of assets and employees. The evidence suggests that it is not just current-year performance but also the trend in company performance over the prior two years that forecasts subsequent firm performance; thus, our findings extend and refine institutional theory. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Ahmadjian, Christina L., Safety in numbers: Downsizing and the deinstitutionalization of permanent employment in Japan, Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, 4, pp. 622-654, (2001); Ahuja, Gautam, Managerial foresight and attempted rent appropriation: Insider trading on knowledge of imminent breakthroughs, Strategic Management Journal, 26, 9, pp. 791-808, (2005); Ancona, Deborah Gladstein, Time: A new research lens, Academy of Management Review, 26, 4, pp. 645-663, (2001); Andrade, Gregor, Investigating the economic role of mergers, Journal of Corporate Finance, 10, 1, pp. 1-36, (2004); Autor, David H., The skill content of recent technological change: An empirical exploration, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, 4, pp. 1279-1333, (2003); Partisan Conflict, (2014); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

Findings: The results indicated that cultural variables interact with board diversity to influence firm performance. Having women on the board in countries with high power distance, individualist, masculine and low-uncertainty avoidance culture influences the firm performance negatively.

Recent studies have recommended that suitable methods can be applied to predict bankruptcy. In this context, this work analyzes Pakistan's banking sector's financial status through the five-factor Altman Z-score model, which determines the probability of bankruptcy for an organization. Banking data has been collected through the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the period 2013-2017. The Z-score assessment criteria is defined as: Z> 2.99-“safe” zone; Z> 1.8 Z>2.98-“grey” zone; and Z <1.8-“distress” zone. Results show good predictions for the local banking industry, while most foreign Pakistani banks were found bankrupt with the Z-score below 1.1. One of the financial risks investors face when investing in any company is the risk of bankruptcy. One of the most used models for predicting financial distress for any company is Altman's Z-score model. On the other hand, the Z-score analysis suggests that all banking establishments are not bankrupt because they have sufficient ability to control bankruptcy. At the same time, foreign banks failed financially and would not be able to be sustained in the future because they do not have the ability to pay the short-term and long-term debt. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Altman Z –score Application; Banking Industry; Bankruptcy; Financial Distress; Five-factors Analysis","","","","1[1] This research was supported by National Science Foundation of China (NSFC;72072166). 1[2] We are grateful to the Editor-in-Chief for his time and many fruitful remarks that significantly improved this research quality. 1[3] The authors declare no conflict of interest. 1[4] Author contribution as follow: Hafeez Ullah: conceptualization, data curation, methodology, writing - original draft, software.

The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach has been applied to identify the efficiency level of MFIs. At the same time, the Pooled Ordinary Least Square (PoOLS) and Generalized Least Square (GeLS) methods comprising the Fixed Effect (FEMod) and Random Effect (REMod) models are used to examine the impact of dimensions of economic freedom and potential determinants on the efficiency level of MFIs. Overall, the results revealed that the technical efficiencies for both social and financial efficiency are contaminated by managerial inefficiency, which is measured by pure technical efficiency. This indicates, although the MFIs had been operating on a relatively optimal scale, they were facing the inefficiency from the managerial side. Besides, the results from the panel regression analysis have implied that both property rights and government integrity under the measurement of rule of law positively influence the MFIs’ financial efficiency. Meanwhile, the impact of government size shows both tax burden and government spending are significantly positive to the social efficiency of MFIs. As the policy implication, the information provides suggestion to the government on how its role can help in improving the efficiency level of MFIs and implements some useful initiatives to help MFIs to sustain in the long term. In addition to that policymakers can identify the relevant inputs of MFIs and thus revise the policy accordingly and design new policies and regulations based on different economic freedom dimensions. The results of the present study provide a reference to guide them in decision making on their investments. For academicians or researchers, they can obtain more information regarding the efficiency of MFIs that is valuable for further research or study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Freedom; Financial Efficiency; Government Size; Microfinance Institutions; Rule Of Law; Social Efficiency; Economic Analysis; Financial Market; Financial Policy; Financial System; Governance Approach; Microfinance; Cambodia; Indonesia; Malaysia; Philippines; Thailand","economic analysis; financial market; financial policy; financial system; governance approach; microfinance; Cambodia; Indonesia; Malaysia; Philippines; Thailand","","","We would like to give thanks to the editors and the anonymous referees of the journal for constructive comments and suggestions, which have significantly helped to improve the contents of the paper.

Second, VCs provide advisory services to promote CSR activities at the invested firms, indicating significant VC treatment effect. Third, the impact of VCs on CSR activities at the invested firms is magnified when the VCs are reputatable or with foreign background.

Less often considered is how different types of internal and external sources of assurance form part of a combined assurance model that organisations rely on to ensure the integrity of information used for internal decision making and reporting to stakeholders. As a result, this paper offers an important contribution to the academic literature by providing one of the first reviews to deal specifically with the operation of combined assurance. The research considers if firm size and profitability, industry membership and select governance features are associated with the use of more sophisticated combined assurance models for ensuring relevant and reliable integrated reporting. Multiple regression, complemented by supplementary analysis, reveals that larger firms that are more profitable and members of environmentally and socially sensitive industries are not necessarily using extensive combined assurance models. These organisations rely on robust assurance methodologies, but the coverage of their combined assurance models is restricted. Similarly, board experience is substituting for the use of complex assurance methodologies. Board size and independence are only associated with a stronger commitment to implementing codes of best practice dealing with combined assurance but not with the coverage of the assurance models or the assurance methodologies being applied. The results may be indicative of the fact that internal controls and systems required to support integrated thinking and reporting are still in a developmental stage, making it difficult for them to be the subject of any formal verification by internal or external assurance providers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined Assurance; Determinants; Integrated Thinking And Reporting; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Decision Making; Environmental Economics; Firm Size; Integrated Approach; Profitability; Stakeholder; Sustainability; Sustainable Development","decision making; environmental economics; firm size; integrated approach; profitability; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development","","","The authors would like to thank the participants of the Meditari Accountancy Research Conference (2018 & 2020) for their comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

This literature review considers—in addition to peer-reviewed journal articles—first-tier gray literature in order to receive the most comprehensive picture possible. Although CoCos that qualify for Basel III have various advantages such as less social costs due to optimal capital regulation and equilibrium leverage, lower default risk, cheaper financing and enhanced returns for issuers, they cause at least as many undesirable effects in the field of moral hazard such as the preference for higher risk-taking of management and equity holders or the acceptance of elevated asset volatility as a result of the high wealth transfer risk for CoCo holders. The explanations for the established CoCo design are multifaceted and vary greatly. In academia, caution needs to be exercised on the tendency to over-engineer the possible future design of CoCos and the myriad of outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Basel Iii Regulation; Contingent Convertible (coco) Bonds; Moral Hazard; Point Of Non-viability (ponv); Security Design","","","","of Philosophy study at the Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were analyzed using generalized structured component analysis. The unit of analysis for this research was LQ45 listed companies at the Indonesian Stock Exchange, taking data from the Indonesia Capital Market Directory (ICMD), and the annual reports and financial reports of these companies. The population researched was as many as 84 companies. For the sample, LQ45 companies with annual reports, financial reports and long-standing, continuous ICMD membership were examined using “purposive sampling.” The research sample was about 22 companies assessed over the course of five years (i.e. 110 samples). Findings: First, GCG has a significant and negative relationship to stock returns; second, financial architecture has a significant and positive relationship to stock returns, financial performance and corporate value; third, stock returns have a significant and positive relationship to financial performance and corporate value; and fourth, financial performance has a significant and positive relationship to stock returns and corporate value. Originality/value: The originality of this research is to be found in its examination and analysis of relationships between stock returns and financial performance, which was discovered to be reciprocal, namely, the relationship between the variables occurring affected each other (causality alternating with turning), whereas in previous studies the relationship between variables was unidirectional. Besides the research undertaken before, an analysis was made to understand the influence of GCG on stock returns, corporate value and financial performance. There are differences in the results between studies that support the conjecture that financial architecture has a significant positive effect on financial performance and corporate value, and also that financial architecture has a significant positive effect on financial performance and corporate value. Given those existing differences, this study reexamines the effect of financial architecture on financial performance and corporate value. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Value; Financial Architecture; Financial Performance; Good Corporate Governance; Return On Investment","","","","","Journal of Risk and Insurance, (1993); Aldamen, Husam, Does good corporate governance enhance accruals quality during financial crises?, Managerial Auditing Journal, 31, 4-5, pp. 434-457, (2016); Aliouche, E.

Over the years, the Nigerian airline industry has been experiencing rising operational costs, probably due to inadequate business process reengineering. Based on the assumptions of the value chain model, this article investigates the effect of business process reengineering on operational costs of selected indigenous airline companies in Nigeria. The descriptive survey research design was adopted for the study. The population was 1,938 employees of key professional departments of the selected Nigerian indigenous airline companies. The sample size was 699 staff of the selected departments with 84% response rate. The copies of the questionnaire were administered using trained research assistants. The study adopted a mixed sampling method. Proportionate sampling was used to determine the sample size for each of the three airlines; stratified sampling was used to select the specific units within the organization, while random sampling was used to select the respondents. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and simple linear regression methods. The descriptive analysis revealed that the overall average and standard deviation for business process reengineering were 2.80 and 0.57, while operational costs were 4.29 and 0.54 respectively. The inferential result showed a positive and significant effect of the business process reengineering on operational costs (R2 = 0.024, β = 0.147, t = 3.709, p < 0.05). Thus, the study concluded that business process reengineering affects the operational costs of the selected indigenous airline companies in Nigeria. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Africa; Airlines; Information Technology; Input; Nigeria; Organization; Output; Value Chain Model","","","","","Altinkemer, Kemal, Business Process Reengineering and Organizational Performance: An Exploration of Issues, International Journal of Information Management, 18, 6, pp. 381-392, (1998); Journal of Business and Economics, (2015); International Journal of Empirical Finance, (2014); Strategic Management and Competitive Advantage Concepts and Cases, (2006); Empirical Modelling for Participative Business Process Reengineering, (2001); Visible Systems Corporation, (1997); Aviation and Its Management Global Challenges and Opportunities, (2019); Process Innovation Reengineering Work Through Information Technology, (1993); Sloan Management Review, (1990); Strategic Management Concepts and Cases, (2001)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","17277051; 18105467","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091863706"

Nowadays, Pakistan is facing a severe liquidity crisis; this study contributes by examining the mediating role of liquidity on the link of corporate governance-performance. We use data from 63 firms from 2010 to 2018, excluding 17 outliers. To analyze the data, we use the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SURE) model and nlcom-Stata test. Our findings support the mediating role of liquidity on the link between corporate governance and performance. In addition, the results show that corporate governance improves performance. Furthermore, the study supports a significant positive association of liquidity and performance. For robustness, we use two performance variables-return on assets (ROA) and Tobin's q (TQ)-where ROA represents full mediation and TQ indicates partial mediation. This study helps to use liquidity policy to strengthen the inside and outside dimensions of corporate governance mechanisms that improve the performance of firms.

Conversely, assessments of the determinants of the aforementioned practices remain limited. In contrast to erstwhile studies, this paper this fills the research gap by offering specific consideration to a divergent methodology in examining the prevalence of smallholder women farmers’ deterrence from MFBs credit, while considering expressions of the premeditated decisions made by the farmers not to apply for loans. Cross-sectional data collected via the administration of questionnaire were further analysed using the loan deterrence indices model (LDI) and the censored Tobit regression (CTR) model. Evidence from results showed a high prevalence of loan deterrence by the farmers. Furthermore, we find that farm size, age of the respondents, household size, annual income, education level, proximity to bank, and accessibility to account officer are strong drivers of loan deterrence in South-East Nigeria. We recommend that MFBs should make loaning conditions “farmer friendly” by introducing more account officers, educating the farmers on terms and conditions to be met on loan contracts, extending credit to farmers irrespective of their age, farm size and annual income among others. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agribusiness; Agriculture; Credit; Discouraged Women; Loan Deterrence; Mfbs; Prevalence; Smallholder Farmers; Women","","","","","Journal of Emerging Trends in Economics and Management Sciences, (2012); Asian Journal of Agriculture and Rural Development, (2012); Central Bank of Nigeria Economic and Financial Review, (2010); Current Research Journal of Social Sciences, (2012); Journal of Development and Agricultural Economics, (2017); Journal of Agriculture, (2016); Brown, Martin, Who needs credit and who gets credit in Eastern Europe?, Economic Policy, 26, 65, pp. 93-130, (2011); Microfinance Policy Regulatory and Supervisory Framework for Nigeria, (2005); Chakravarty, Sugato, The international evidence on discouraged small businesses, Journal of Empirical Finance, 20, 1, pp. 63-82, (2013); An Interpretation of Discouraged Borrowers Based on Relationship Lending, (2010)","","Online Academic Press","","","","","","2577767X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171472068"

To the effect, the meaning of financial distress (FD) is clarified, as well as the criteria under which a company would be classified as a company with or without FD. Additionally, the study applies two models that are widely used in the middle: multiple discriminant analysis and logistic regression, based on the previous works of Altman and Ohlson, respectively. The research has focused on companies in the Ecuadorian manufacturing sector during the period 2014-2018. As one of the main results, the study found that the signs of the coefficients of the estimated models differ in some cases with respect to those of the original Altman and Ohlson models. Despite this, the precision rates of the present study are higher than those of the original models in both cases.

This study collects data from 975 observations during the period 2012 to 2018 to test the hypotheses using multiple linear regression model for the panel data. In this research, the independent variable of corporate governance index comprises of 27 specific corporate governance attributes. The results of hypothesis testing showed that corporate governance has a negative and significant effect on the rate of capital cost. In other words, the quality of corporate governance can lower the rate of capital cost. This result suggests that, by using a powerful corporate governance system and by declining the information asymmetry (increasing transparency) and agency conflict, we would be able to enhance the quality of financial reports. It would strengthen the capital market, attract financial suppliers and investors, and absorb the required financial resources of the firm by a lower rate.

In this study, we explore how firms could possibly enhance the financial returns of R&D investments through quality management, using Six Sigma implementation as an example, and efficiency improvement, using the stochastic frontier estimation of relative efficiency as a proxy. Based on data from 468 manufacturing firms in the United States over the period 2007–2014, we construct a dynamic panel data model to capture the effects of R&D investments on firms’ financial returns in terms of Tobin's q. Using the system generalized method of moments estimator, our results indicate that the financial returns of R&D investments are significantly enhanced when firms adopt Six Sigma and improve efficiency in operations. Our additional analyses further suggest that such an enhancement effect through quality and efficiency improvements is more pronounced under high operational complexity as approximated by labor intensity and geographical diversity. Instead of considering innovation activities and process management as contradictory functions, we show that quality and efficiency improvements indeed support firms’ R&D investments, leading to higher financial returns. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Operational Efficiency; R&d Investments; Six Sigma; Tobin's Q","","","","We thank the Editors and anonymous referees for their many helpful comments on earlier versions of our paper.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the variables that affect the financial distress of SOEs in Indonesia that have received government subsidies. This research is a quantitative study conducted using secondary data collected from the Indonesian Stock Exchange, from a total of 19 SOEs from 2014 to 2017. The analysis found that investment (X2INV), leverage (X3LEV), cash flow from operating (X4CFO), and firm size (X5SIZE) have a significant negative effect on financial distress in SOEs. It means that increases in these variables will reduce the potential for corporate financial distress. While the independent working capital (X1WC) variable has no significant effect on financial distress, because it is temporary and has a dynamic change, so it is unable to show its influence on financial distress. SOE’s management that receives government subsidies can increase the amount of profitable investment to increase marginal revenue, thereby reducing financial distress. Higher leverage can reduce the level of financial distress, indicating that management uses debt to finance projects that generate higher marginal revenue than marginal costs. This condition has an impact on increasing operating cash flow.

We also seek to understand the contextual factors that facilitate the adoption of BI systems. Design/methodology/approach: We adopt Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and event study methodology, and analyze the financial data for a sample of 144 US firms which adopted BI systems from 2005–2014, and compare them to control firms without BI systems. Findings: We find that the implementation of BI systems leads to higher operational capability, particularly for large high-tech firms with high technology intensity. We further show that technology intensity and firm size are important contextual factors for firms to reap the benefits of BI systems. Practical implications: We demonstrate how benefits from the adoption of BI systems are likely to be strengthened. The benefits of BI systems depend on firms' technology intensity and firm size of high-tech firms. Accessing relevant and timely reports for decision-making is particularly important in the highly dynamic, volatile and competitive high-tech sectors. Originality/value: We contribute to the literature by providing empirical evidence that the adoption of BI systems can improve firms' operational capability and show that technology intensity and firm size are important contextual factors for firms to reap the benefits of BI systems.

This study aims to analyze the effect of corporate characteristics on financial distress (FD), which is moderated by corporate governance (audit quality), and uses the controlling variables (inflation rate and GDP). The study uses data from audited financial statements from mining sector in the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2013-2018. Since the dependent variable (FD) is dichotomous, this study used a binary logistic regression model, as it is the case in many studies regarding the probability of bankruptcy filing. In line with the current study and some previous studies, leverage, efficiency (activity), market-to-book value, audit quality, and GDP affect the probability of financial distress significantly. Only liquidity and inflation do not impact FD. Besides, the moderating audit quality weakens the effect of liquidity and PBV; otherwise, it strengthens leverage and efficiency in predicting financial distress. As for managerial implications, this study concludes that corporate performance, corporate governance, and macro-risk factors affect the probability of financial distress. The authors suggest that mining firms need to pay attention to corporate governance and should watch the economic condition for business sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audit Quality; Corporate Characteristics; Corporate Governance; Financial Distress; Macro-risk","","","","","Altman, Edward I., Corporate Financial Distress, Restructuring, and Bankruptcy: Analyze Leveraged Finance, Distressed Debt, and Bankruptcy, Fourth Edition, pp. 1-349, (2019); Journal of Economics and Business Dharma Andalas, (2017); Diponegoro Journal of Accounting, (2015); Jurnal Administrasi Bisnis S1 Universitas Brawijaya, (2017); Beaver, William H., Financial statement analysis and the prediction of financial distress, Foundations and Trends in Accounting, 5, 2, pp. 99-173, (2010); Principles of Corporate Finance, (2000); International Business Research, (2014); Fundamentals of Financial Management, (1995); Theoretical and Applied Economics, (2016); Causholli, Monika, Lending relationships, auditor quality and debt costs, Managerial Auditing Journal, 27, 6, pp. 550-572, (2012)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18129358; 18104967","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087092664"

Drawing on the board perspective of the firm, this paper examines the effect of gender diversity and the mediating effect of the existence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee. To test the paper's objectives, the authors use an international sample of analysis of 29,951 firm-year observations from 2012 to 2018. The results suggest that female directors on the board significantly encourage the firm's affiliation with the UN GC and support the mediating effect of the existence of a CSR committee. Therefore, the positive impact of female directors on UN GC signatories appears to be mediated by the existence of a CSR committee. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Gender Diversity; Csr Committee; United Nations Global Compact; Corporate Social Responsibility; Female; Firm Size; Gender; United Nations","corporate social responsibility; female; firm size; gender; United Nations","","","","Cetindamar, Dilek Kozanoglu, Corporate social responsibility practices and environmentally responsible behavior: The case of the United Nations global compact, Journal of Business Ethics, 76, 2, pp. 163-176, (2007); Janney, Jay J., Glass houses?

Knowledge about how much an enterprise is worth is of fundamental importance for both the owner of that company and investors when negotiating the price of an enterprise at the time of conducting a commercial transaction. The article presents the goals of the company's valuation and characteristic stages of the company's life at which such valuation is necessary. The article classifies the methods of enterprise valuation used today. On this basis, the valuation methodology is presented according to the MDI-R concept (Assets, Income, Intellectual Capital-Market), which in a broad spectrum measures the effectiveness of the company's operations and, in accordance with the current features of good valuation, aims to determine the fair value of the company. The purpose of the article is to demonstrate the need to improve the code of conduct and valuation standards. As part of the implementation of the objective, multi-faceted and complex valuation issues are presented, as well as factors that may distort the determination of fair value. The methodology of the study is based on inferences about the methodology of business valuation, and verification is based on practical examples, by which a hypothesis on the existence of critical elements of valuation is verified that allows the use of broad subjectivity in estimating the value of assets. At the same time, the factors that determine the possibility of the existence of too wide a subjectivity in estimating assets, which is in contradiction with the features of good valuation, are presented. The attempt is made to draw attention to the threats arising from modern business valuation methodologies and their challenges in the future. Additionally, this article offers the authors' proposed hybrid method MDI-R, which draws from existing solutions to improve their functionality and applicability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Finance; Creating Value; Financial Market; Management; Valuation Of The Company; Business; Commercialization; Conceptual Framework; Firm Ownership; Market System; Methodology; Negotiation Process; Valuation","business; commercialization; conceptual framework; firm ownership; market system; methodology; negotiation process; valuation","","","Funding: The project was financed within the framework of the program of the Minister of Science and Higher Education in Poland under the name “Regional Excellence Initiative” in the years 2019–2022, project number 001/RID/2018/19, the amount of financing PLN 10,684,000.00.","Valuation of Companies, (2005); Mohnen, Pierre A., Innovation and Productivity: An Update, Eurasian Business Review, 3, 1, pp. 47-65, (2013); Ngo, Liem Viet, Innovation and business success: The mediating role of customer participation, Journal of Business Research, 66, 8, pp. 1134-1142, (2013); Stryjakiewicz, Tadeusz, Role of creative industries in the post-socialist urban transformation, Quaestiones Geographicae, 33, 2, pp. 19-35, (2014); J Account Financ, (2013); Schumpeter, Joseph A., Essays: On entrepreneurs, innovations, business cycles and the evolution of capitalism, pp. 1-341, (2017); Basis Business Appraisal, (1984); Methods of Measurement and Development of Enterprises, (2007); Corporate Valuation Tools for Effective Appraisal and Decision Making, (1993); Financial Management and Business Valuation, (2009)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083654918"

Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes 151 French firms listed on the CAC ALL shares index from 2006 to 2015. The paper uses the feasible generalized least square regression technique to test the relationship between CEO characteristics and earnings management. Findings: Using discretionary accruals as a proxy for earnings management, the results obtained from the three models (Jones modified 1995; Kothari et al., 2005; Raman and Shahrur, 2008) indicated that there is a positive and significant relationship between CEO duality, CEO nationality and the quality of financial communication. However, no significant relationship was found between CEO board member, CEO turnover and earnings management. Originality/value: A literature review finds that fewer studies have investigated the relationship between earnings management practices and personal CEO characteristics in the French context. Furthermore, no study yet has examined the influence of CEO nationality and CEO age on earnings management practices. This study provides empirical data about the impact of CEO’s characteristics on earnings management and how these different characteristics can facilitate the transition to manipulate and influence the quality of financial communication. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Characteristics; Ceo Expertise; Ceo Gender; Ceo Nationality; Discretionary Accruals; Earnings Management","","","","The authors would like to thank Deanship of Scientific Research at Majmaah University for supporting this work under Project Number No. 1440-144.","Adams, Renée B., Powerful CEOs and their impact on corporate performance, Review of Financial Studies, 18, 4, pp. 1403-1432, (2005); Akhtaruddin, M., Corporate mandatory disclosure practices in Bangladesh, International Journal of Accounting, 40, 4, pp. 399-422, (2005); Al-Sraheen, Deaa Al Deen Omar, Proposing a model for limiting earning management practices: The case of Jordanian listed firms, Corporate Board: Role, Duties and Composition, 12, 3, pp. 81-84, (2016); Harvard Business Review, (1986); Ali, Ashiq, CEO tenure and earnings management, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 59, 1, pp. 60-79, (2015); Alqatamin, Rateb Mohammad Hamad, The effect of the CEO's characteristics on EM: Evidence from Jordan, International Journal of Accounting and Information Management, 25, 3, pp. 356-375, (2017); Alsaeed, Khalid, The association between firm-specific characteristics and disclosure: The case of Saudi Arabia, Managerial Auditing Journal, 21, 5, pp. 476-496, (2006); Altamuro, Jennifer L.M., The effects of accelerated revenue recognition on earnings management and earnings informativeness: Evidence from SEC staff accounting bulletin No. 101, Accounting Review, 80, 2, pp. 373-401, (2005); Alzoubi, Ebraheem Saleem Salem, Audit quality, debt financing, and earnings management: Evidence from Jordan, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 30, pp. 69-84, (2018); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Sciences, (2013)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","19852517; 20425856","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078944770"

For the period 2005–2010, the results indicate the political inference in CEO turnover decision for the Romanian listed companies. In this period, with great turmoil in the economy determined by the financial crisis of 2008, we also find that CEO gender helps to explain the probability of changing the CEO. Moreover, this paper empirically tests if the financial and corporate governance determinants that are validated in the existing literature work for the Romanian listed companies.

However, in communication, business, and management studies, heuristics can be understood as simple cognitive processes that allow assessments, predictions, and decisions to be made quickly and efficiently by consumers and economic agents. This aspect can sometimes lead to cognitive biases, especially when little information is available or in situations of high uncertainty. The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of heuristic judgments in social media on corporate reputation ratings obtained in Spanish leader companies. Using data collected in Spain, this paper analyzes the influence of heuristics concerning news items on corporate reputation, measured by the Monitor Empresarial de Reputacion Corporativa (MERCO) Index. The main finding of this paper is that the total number of news items has a positive effect on corporate reputation, particularly in the categories of culture-values, results/image, expansion, and sponsorship/donations. Additionally, this work serves as a repository of knowledge applicable to similar situations considering the specificities of each particular case. The importance to intervene on certain variables at different levels of managerial performance is described and implications for companies are discussed in these pages. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Reputation; Heuristics; Information Processing; Social Media; Stakeholders; Corporate Strategy; Heuristics; Information Management; Knowledge; Repository; Social Media; Stakeholder; Spain","corporate strategy; heuristics; information management; knowledge; repository; social media; stakeholder; Spain","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by Universidad Internacional de La Rioja grant number B0036-1920.

Therefore, the control and management of insurance companies and their administration of entrusted resources are under strict control and are regulated by the Solvency II Directive in European Union law. The Czech and Slovak insurance markets have a common history. Currently, both markets are part of the European Union’s single insurance market.

The study was conducted in five ASEAN countries - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Thailand from 2014 - 2017. The research sample was collected from companies with the ACGS data and obtained with the help of 359 company observations. Hypothesis testing was performed using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS). The results of the study do not support all hypotheses. The ACGS has no effect on sustainability reporting. The ACGS has a significant negative effect on firm value, while sustainability reporting has a negative and insignificant effect on firm value. The ACGS and sustainability reporting are not good news for investors. This research’s limitation is that companies rarely disclose the final value of the ACGS in their annual reports, so this research uses content analysis. The weakness of content analysis is the researchers’ subjectivity so that the point of view between researchers is different. Besides, sustainability reporting for several ASEAN countries is voluntary, so not all companies can be sampled, which ultimately affects interpretation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Governance; Corporate Governance Scorecard; Firm Va; Sustainability Reporting","","","","","Abdelfattah, Tarek, Tax avoidance, corporate governance, and corporate social responsibility: The case of the Egyptian capital market, Journal of International Accounting, Auditing and Taxation, 38, (2020); Adel, Christine, Is corporate governance relevant to the quality of corporate social responsibility disclosure in large European companies?, International Journal of Accounting and Information Management, 27, 2, pp. 301-332, (2019); Ahmadi, Ali, Chief Executive Officer attributes, board structures, gender diversity and firm performance among French CAC 40 listed firms, Research in International Business and Finance, 44, pp. 218-226, (2018); Farooque, Omar Al, Determinants of social and economic reportings: Evidence from Australia, the UK and South african multinational enterprises, International Journal of Accounting and Information Management, 25, 2, pp. 177-200, (2017); Ammann, Manuel, Corporate governance and firm value: International evidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 18, 1, pp. 36-55, (2011); Amran, Azlan Bin, Evidence in development of sustainability reporting: A case of a developing country, Business Strategy and the Environment, 20, 3, pp. 141-156, (2011); Arayssi, Mahmoud, Women on boards, sustainability reporting and firm performance, Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal, 7, 3, pp. 376-401, (2016); Bachoo, Kaveen, Firm Value and the Quality of Sustainability Reporting in Australia, Australian Accounting Review, 23, 1, pp. 67-87, (2013); Barnett, Michael L., Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 11, pp. 1101-1122, (2006); Becchetti, Leonardo, Corporate social responsibility and shareholder's value, Journal of Business Research, 65, 11, pp. 1628-1635, (2012)","","Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA)","","","","","","22884645; 22884637","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097248306"

For the Panel-NARDL model, the Pre-crisis regime comprises of 289 observations from 1st January 2000 to 1st January 2008, the post-crisis regime consists of 547 observations from 1st January 2009 to May 2020 and the whole sample is constituted upon 960 observations from 1st January 2000 to May 2020. Pesaran’s 2007 cross-sectional augmented IPS unit root test is also applied after estimating Pesaran’s 2004 CD test. Findings indicated that the linear panel-based ARDL model failed to establish long-term cointegration between exchange rate fluctuation and stock indexes before the global financial crisis and when the overall sample period is selected. However, the asymmetrical panel-based ARDL model established a non-linear long-term association between exchange rate fluctuation and stock indexes in three regimes. Moreover in long run, when the whole sample is selected, investors reacted to only positive shocks to exchange rate and did not react to negative shocks. However, in the short run investors reacted equally to both positive and negative shocks to exchange rates. In pre-crisis and post-crisis regimes, stock indexes are only inversely related to positive shocks to exchange rate fluctuations and investors did not react to negative fluctuations in the exchange rate. However, in the short run and before the global financial crisis, investors reacted to only positive shocks to exchange rate but in the short run and after the crisis, investors did not react to positive shocks. The significance of this research is two-fold: Firstly, we have examined the reaction of investors to both positive and negative shocks to exchange rate fluctuations under three different regimes. Secondly, we have shown that non-linear panel-based modelling is more effectual in estimating asymmetrical linkages between exchange rate fluctuation and stock indexes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric Granger Causality Analysis; Cross-sectional Augmented Ips Unit Root; Exchange Rate And Stock Prices; Global Financial Crisis; Non-linear Panel Ardl; South Asian Stock Indexes","","","","","Adjasi, Charles Komla Delali, Stock prices and exchange rate dynamics in selected African countries: a bivariate analysis, African Journal of Economic and Management Studies, 2, 2, pp. 143-164, (2011); Akbar, Muhammad Ali, Bayesian analysis of dynamic linkages among gold price, stock prices, exchange rate and interest rate in Pakistan, Resources Policy, 62, pp. 154-164, (2019); al-Hajj, Ekhlas, Oil price shocks and stock returns nexus for Malaysia: Fresh evidence from nonlinear ARDL test, Energy Reports, 4, pp. 624-637, (2018); Andriansyah, Andriansyah, Stock prices, exchange rates and portfolio equity flows: A Toda-Yamamoto Panel Causality Test, Journal of Economic Studies, 46, 2, pp. 399-421, (2019); Anisak, Nurul, Foreign Exchange Exposure of Indonesian Listed Firms, Global Business Review, 21, 4, pp. 918-936, (2020); Aravind, M., FX Volatility Impact on Indian Stock Market: An Empirical Investigation, Vision, 21, 3, pp. 284-294, (2017); Areli Bermudez Delgado, Nancy, The relationship between oil prices, the stock market and the exchange rate: Evidence from Mexico, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 45, pp. 266-275, (2018); South Asian Journal of Global Business Research, (2014); Pardigms A Journal of Commerce Economics and Social Sciences, (2009); Kashmir Economic Review, (2019)","","Cogent OA","","","","","","23311975","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096299992"

It provides empirical investigation for 73 non-financial firms in India from 2009 to 2016. The fixed effect model (FEM) regression was used to measure the association between the variables. Results indicate that board structure index and firm size have a significant impact on return on capital employed and return on assets. It is also observed that the ownership structure index and leverage have positive but insignificant impact on firms' performance. The research, therefore, proposes that policymakers and legislative bodies interpret this proof as a motive for them to improve the procedures of corporate boards to cope efficiently with the distinctive characteristics of corporate governance in emerging markets such as India by using Nifty 100 as a case. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Structure Index; Company Performance; India.; Osi; Ownership Structure Index","","","","","Abdallah, Abed Al Nasser, Corporate governance practices, ownership structure, and corporate performance in the GCC countries, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 46, pp. 98-115, (2017); Abdullah, Shamsul Nahar, Board composition, CEO duality and performance among Malaysian listed companies, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 4, 4, pp. 47-61, (2004); Iosr Journal of Business and Management, (2013); Alahdal, Waleed M., The impact of corporate governance on financial performance of Indian and GCC listed firms: An empirical investigation, Research in International Business and Finance, 51, (2020); Al-Malkawi, Husam Aldin Nizar, Corporate governance practices in emerging markets: The case of GCC countries, Economic Modelling, 38, pp. 133-141, (2014); Corporate Board Role Duties and Composition, (2017); Al-Matari, Ebrahim Mohammed, Audit committee characteristics and executive committee characteristics and firm performance in Oman: Empirical study, Asian Social Science, 10, 12, pp. 98-113, (2014); Ownership Structure and Corporate Performance Evidence from Qatar, (2012); Ammann, Manuel, Corporate governance and firm value: International evidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 18, 1, pp. 36-55, (2011); Ararat, Melsa, The effect of corporate governance on firm value and profitability: Time-series evidence from Turkey, Emerging Markets Review, 30, pp. 113-132, (2017)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","14779048; 1741802X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095762105"

However, most of the relevant publications do not have any retrospective analysis of this topic in terms of knowledge domain to show its development trends and research concerns. To address this issue, two effective bibliometric tools namely Citespace II (The 5.3.R4 Edition) and SciMat are used to analyze the knowledge domain of this field in this paper. We have analyzed 979 articles related to fund performance from Web of Science between 1966 and 2019 (July), the analysis content includes the current status, collaboration network, co-citation network, and emerging trends of fund performance research, then we have derived the following desired conclusions: (1) In the last twenty years, there was a significant increase in the publication and citation numbers of fund performance research; especially, the relative research has become interdisciplinary and internationalized. (2) “Mutual Fund Performance”, “Fund Return”, “Investment Performance”, and “Portfolio Selection” are the hottest topics in the fund performance research. (3) “Small Fund” and “Investor Reaction” are the two emerging trends in the fund performance research. To sum up, there are two main contributions in this paper: First, we provide a full bibliometric analysis about the fund performance research. Second, we make the further development of fund performance research easier and more clearly to show the directions to learn and study for beginners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bibliometric Overview; C10; Citespace; Emerging Trend; Fund Performance; G10; G24; Hottest Topics; Investment; Knowledge; Research And Development","investment; knowledge; research and development","","","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants [71840001] and Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Commission of Yunnan Province under Grant [2017FB102].","Agarwal, Vikas, Mandatory Portfolio Disclosure, Stock Liquidity, and Mutual Fund Performance, Journal of Finance, 70, 6, pp. 2733-2776, (2015); Angelidis, Timotheos, Revisiting mutual fund performance evaluation, Journal of Banking and Finance, 37, 5, pp. 1759-1776, (2013); Aragon, George O., Share restrictions and asset pricing: Evidence from the hedge fund industry, Journal of Financial Economics, 83, 1, pp. 33-58, (2007); Avramov, Doron, Hedge funds, managerial skill, and macroeconomic variables, Journal of Financial Economics, 99, 3, pp. 672-692, (2011); Babalos, Vasilios, Towards a Holistic Approach for Mutual Fund Performance Appraisal, Computational Economics, 46, 1, pp. 35-53, (2015); Banegas, Ayelen, The cross section of conditional mutual fund performance in European stock markets, Journal of Financial Economics, 108, 3, pp. 699-726, (2013); Barnett, Michael L., Beyond dichotomy: The curvilinear relationship between social responsibility and financial performance, Strategic Management Journal, 27, 11, pp. 1101-1122, (2006); Basso, Antonella, A data envelopment analysis approach to measure the mutual fund performance, European Journal of Operational Research, 135, 3, pp. 477-492, (2001); Bauer, Rob M.M.J., International evidence on ethical mutual fund performance and investment style, Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, 7, pp. 1751-1767, (2005); Economics of Mutual Fund Markets Competition Versus Regulation, (1990)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","1331677X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084364217"

Our results are suggestive of heterogeneous effects of CG mechanisms on firm value and profitability in that they might have either encouraged or discouraged FV in Saudi Arabia. This means that, averagely, better-governed firms tend to achieve better market value, but not necessarily a better accounting value. Our findings indicate that implementing a voluntary 'comply-or-explain' CG regime in Saudi Arabia has, so far, a limited impact on FV. This implies that developing other enforcement mechanisms for CG provisions, such as appending good CG practices to listing rules for companies to comply with, might lead to better financial results for those well-governed companies in Saudi Arabia.

However, the empirical literature is inconclusive on what an optimal government intervention program should be applied to identifies the areas of improvement that can be addressed by managerial decisions or policy activities to mitigate the consequences of the banking sector crises. The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual framework that will investigate the moderating effect of corporate governance between government intervention and the performance of the banking sector. This framework will apply a technique that will identify the areas of improvement that can be addressed by managerial decisions or regulatory authorities, by extending the application of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using an importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) to determine the priority factors that should receive management’s attention.

Accrual-based models are often used to examine the motives of managers in conducting discretionary accruals. Discretionary accruals by managers has a very broad impact and may mislead users of financial statements. This study analyses and examines the effect of company profitability on discretionary accruals, especially in emerging markets in Indonesia. This empirical study samples manufacturing sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2006 to 2016 and uses dynamic models with Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation. This paper finds that the motives for signalling managers still influences the existence of discretionary accruals, and ROA, PBV, and EPS have a positive and significant effect on discretionary accruals. These findings prove that managers engage in discretionary accrual when reporting the profitability of the company. Leverage negatively affects discretionary accrual and the control mechanism of the current debt even though the effect is marginal. This study only examines the profitability motives of managers in conveying information to outsiders, and acknowledges that discretionary accruals may be influenced by variables beyond this study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Discretionary Accrual; Leverage; Profitability; Signalling Motive; Supply Chain Management","","","","","Dechow, Patricia M., Detecting Earnings Management: A New Approach, Journal of Accounting Research, 50, 2, pp. 275-334, (2012); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2014); Vol 8, (2009); International Journal of Innovation and Applied Studies, (2014); Fak Ekon Dan Bisnis Univ, (2017); Kiattikulwattana, Prapaporn, Earnings management and voluntary disclosure of management's responsibility for the financial reports, Asian Review of Accounting, 22, 3, pp. 233-256, (2014); Shette, Rachappa, Opportunistic earnings management during initial public offerings: Evidence from India, Review of Accounting and Finance, 15, 3, pp. 352-371, (2016); Ahmad-Zaluki, Nurwati Ashikkin, Earnings management in Malaysian IPOs: The East Asian crisis, ownership control, and post-IPO performance, International Journal of Accounting, 46, 2, pp. 111-137, (2011); Khalil, Mohamed, Efficient contracting, earnings smoothing and managerial accounting discretion, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 15, 1, pp. 100-122, (2014); Huang, Pinghsun, Ethical management, corporate governance, and abnormal accruals, Journal of Business Ethics, 83, 3, pp. 469-487, (2008)","","ExcelingTech excelingtech@gmail.com","","","","","","20513771; 20507399","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080952154"

Currently, the Nigerian manufacturing sector experiences a decline in financial sustainability, thus forcing financially unsustainable companies out of business. Financial practices that improve the long-term financial position and performance need to be implemented. These financial practices can be measured across short-term profitability, efficiency, liquidity and solvency. Some studies have considered sustainability from a financial perspective using one or two measures but very few focus on the Nigerian manufacturing sector. This study fills these gaps by investigating the impact of financial practices on financial sustainability across these measures. Panel dataset for 17 companies from 2008 to 2016 was collected and analysed using the correlation matrix and random effect model. All regressors were significant in explaining financial distress. However, only short-term profitability and efficiency ratios were consistently significant across all three models, thus indicating the superiority of financial practices that affect short-term profits and efficiency. The study recommends that companies should implement financial policies that address periodic costs and productivity while maximizing marketing efforts simultaneously. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Earnings Management; Financial Distress; Financial Ratio; Financial Sustainability; Sustainable Growth","","","","","Study Commissioned by the Welfare Association Consortium, (2002); Adeyemi, Babalola A., Bank failure in Nigeria: A consequence of capital inadequacy, lack of transparency and non-performing loans?, Banks and Bank Systems, 6, 1, pp. 99-109, (2011); Journal of Business and Management, (2013); How to Achieve 10 Real Sector Contribution to Gdp by 2015stakeholders, (2012); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Corporate Financial Distress and Bankruptcy, (1993); Altman, Edward I., Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z- Score and ZETA® models, pp. 428-455, (2013); Altman, Edward I., Corporate Financial Distress and Bankruptcy: Predict and Avoid Bankruptcy, Analyze and Invest in Distressed Debt, Third Edition, (2011); Distressed Firm and Bankruptcy Prediction in an International Context A Review and Empirical Analysis of Altmans Z Score Model, (2014); International Journal of Business and Social Science, (2011)","","Cogent OA info@CogentOA.com","","","","","","23322039","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079432763"

Similarly, transparency and disclosure (TD) have an insignificant negative impact on firms' performance measured by Tobin's Q. Moreover, the country dummy results show that Indian firms are performing better than Gulf countries ones in terms of corporate governance practices and financial performance.

Measuring the different term effects on credit risk by the slope of credit default swap (CDS) spreads with different maturities, we investigate how CSR activities affect credit risk differently in the short and long run. Fama-MacBeth regressions reveal that firms with higher CSR scores tend to have more gently decreasing CDS slopes because, on average, CSR activities reduce credit risk in the long run more than in the short run. An analysis of individual CSR categories shows that while community, diversity and employee relations lead to a lower CDS slope, human rights and product characteristics increase the CDS slope. This finding suggests that not all CSR activities affect short-term and long-term credit risks in the same direction.

Based on analyzing the connotation, characteristics and influencing factors of technology standard alliance collaborative innovation, this paper puts forward the research hypothesis and theoretical framework of alliance collaborative innovation, and then uses a questionnaire survey and a Structural Equation Model to test the influencing factors and their effect path through 196 technology standard alliance enterprises samples. The results indicate that compared with strategy collaboration and process collaboration, patent collaboration has more significant positive impacts on alliance innovation performance; further, resource integration, knowledge sharing and revenue distribution, become the main influencing factors of alliance collaborative innovation.

Using the resource dependence and agency views, this paper examines how business group affiliation influences the relationship between board diversity and firm performance as a contextual/confounding factor. Based on data for listed firms in India, we find that board demographic diversity is positively associated with the firm performance (Tobin's Q) of standalone firms, but this association is negative for group-affiliated firms. This negative effect of group affiliation is confirmed in a test based on a novel measure of firm performance using the stock market reaction to the announcement of mergers and acquisitions. For both measures of performance, we show that business group affiliation impairs the positive firm value effects of board demographic diversity. These findings imply that the relationship between board diversity and firm performance requires re-examination in the many countries where group affiliation is common. Our results also provide evidence of a new cost of group affiliation and show in a fresh context that cross-country studies should account for international variations in ownership and institutional structures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Diversity; Business Groups; Corporate Governance; India; Institutional Structure; Mergers And Acquisitions (m&a)","","","","We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for suggestions that significantly improved the paper.

Design/methodology/approach: The Jones model and modified Jones model by Dechow et al. (1995) were used to determine the discretionary accruals (DA) of 288 Malaysian listed firms with lowest positive earnings for the years 2013‒2015. Findings: The results of the ordinary least squares regression indicate that only tenure, gender and ethnicity of the ACC are associated with DA. A further test was conducted by dividing firms into two groups: firms whose boards are chaired by a family member and firms whose boards are chaired by a non-family member. The results reveal that it is possible for firms whose boards are chaired by family members to cause the corporate governance (CG) mechanisms, particularly the audit committee, to lose their effectiveness in overcoming the EM problem. In addition, robustness tests were conducted by using panel data regression, where the results were found to be similar to the original regression results. Originality/value: This study alerts policymakers, firms and their stakeholders, as well as researchers, regarding the importance of having an independent board chairman, who has no relationship with any directors or major shareholders, as this may hinder the effectiveness of CG mechanisms in curbing EM, especially in emerging countries, such as Malaysia, where it is very difficult to stop members of the family from becoming board directors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audit Committee Chairman; Corporate Governance; Earnings Management; Malaysia","","","","The authors wish to thank Universiti Utara Malaysia for funding this research.","Do Women Directors Constraint Accrual Management Malaysian Evidence, (2012); Abdullah, Shamsul Nahar, Women directors, family ownership and earnings management in Malaysia, Asian Review of Accounting, 24, 4, pp. 525-550, (2016); Iium Journal of Economics and Management, (2004); Abdul Rahman, Rashidah Binti, Board, audit committee, culture and earnings management: Malaysian evidence, Managerial Auditing Journal, 21, 7, pp. 783-804, (2006); Abernathy, John L., The association between characteristics of audit committee accounting experts, audit committee chairs, and financial reporting timeliness, Advances in Accounting, 30, 2, pp. 283-297, (2014); Adams, Renée B., A theory of friendly boards, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 217-250, (2007); Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Aguilera, Ruth, Firm family firms: Current debates of corporate governance in family firms, Journal of Family Business Strategy, 3, 2, pp. 66-69, (2012); Al-Absy, Mujeeb Saif Mohsen, Accounting expertise in the audit committee and earnings management, Business and Economic Horizons, 14, 3, pp. 451-476, (2018); Al-Absy, Mujeeb Saif Mohsen, Board chairmen’s involvement in the nomination and remuneration committees and earnings management, Australasian Accounting, Business and Finance Journal, 12, 4, pp. 60-76, (2018)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","17574331; 17574323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075454732"

Our study examines how the structuring of the corporate board plays a vital role in informing foreign investors about the risk of being expropriated, which affects their decisions to make equity investments in firms in weak institutional regimes. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of large listed Indian firms in the period 2010–2014, we hypothesize that the presence of affiliate directors on the board has a negative impact on foreign investments. Likewise, the presence of controlling owners-directors on the board together with chief executive officers' additional directorial positions has an inverted U-shaped impact on foreign investments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By making use of agency theory and focusing on the importance of foreign financing, our study highlighted the factors that deter foreign investors from providing capital to firms in weak institutional regimes. The use of this theoretical perspective, by emphasizing the differences in agency problems prevalent in strong versus weak institutional regimes, further suggested that examination of the structure of corporate boards is an important way to detect and gauge the potential for expropriation in countries suffering from weaknesses in investor protection. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study has important implications for corporations operating in markets suffering from a legal environment that offers little investor protection. Investors are less prone to invest in these countries, as the risk of expropriation by dominant shareholders means they cannot be sure of actually getting the putative return. Our work shows how corporations can structure their boards effectively to convince investors that they face less danger of expropriation and so attract foreign capital. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affiliate Directors; Ceo “busyness”; Controlling Shareholders; Corporate Governance; Foreign Equity Investment; Weak Institutional Regimes","","","","","Northwestern Journal of International Law Business, (2009); Seattle University Law Review, (2011); Indian Economic Review, (1997); Aguilera, Ruth, The cross-national diversity of corporate governance: Dimensions and determinants, Academy of Management Review, 28, 3, pp. 447-465, (2003); Anderson, Ronald C., Board characteristics, accounting report integrity, and the cost of debt, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 37, 3, pp. 315-342, (2004); Anderson, Ronald C., Founding-Family Ownership and Firm Performance: Evidence from the S&P 500, Journal of Finance, 58, 3, pp. 1301-1327, (2003); Anderson, Ronald C., Board composition: Balancing family influence in S&P 500 firms, Administrative Science Quarterly, 49, 2, pp. 209-237, (2004); Beykent University Journal of Social Sciences, (2013); Relation Between Firm Level Corporate Governance and Market Value A Study of India, (2010); Balasubramanian, N., Corporate governance and the Indian institutional context: Emerging mechanisms and challenges.

An empirical model based on panel data obtained from 112 Jordanian listed companies between 2005 and 2017 is used to test correlation between CS and corporate performance to determine the statistical significance of the relationship. The research findings show that the accounting performance measure that best explains the connection between CS and FP for all the companies listed on ASE is Return on Assets (ROA). From this model, a conclusion can be reached that firm size and asset growth have a significant positive impact on ROA while short-term and total debt levels have a significant negative impact on ROA for all the corporations listed on ASE. The proxies for CS have the same effects on ROE, in which case the effect of total debt is not statistically significant. Moreover, total debt has a statistically significant impact on EPS and Tobin’s Q for all the sectors.

Non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) algorithms are applied to detect disruptive events in the technology sector. The sample consists of 255 NASDAQ technology firms. The annual data used in this study capture votes on managerial proposals for the election and compensation of directors over the period 2003 to 2017. Voting decisions reflect two major disruptive events during that period: the financial crisis and the Facebook initial public offering. These two disruptive events are observed to substantially change the underlying trends behind voting decisions in the technology sector.

On the basis of a cross-national sample consisting of 359 firm-year observations between 2013 and 2016, we find that MDQ is positively associated with learning effects, gender diversity, and the assurance of nonfinancial information in the integrated report. On the other hand, we find that IR readability, listing in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and earnings management do not affect MDQ. Our results are robust to different statistical models.

Using an extensive dataset of manually collected EAs, employing event study and multivariate analyses, we investigate the impact of EAs on key bank stakeholders, i.e. shareholders and depositors. Our findings suggest that equity market and depositors are able to discriminate EAs based on their severity. Market reacts negatively following severe EAs (cease and desist) while weak reaction is noted for other EA types (civil money penalty and formal agreements). Demand depositors exhibit some level of depositor disciplining mechanism following cease and desist announcements, while core depositors seem to reward sanctioned banks for a higher return. A positive effect is found following formal agreement announcements that seem to be perceived as a corrective mechanism. We validate these findings across the sanctioned (treatment) and comparable non-sanctioned (control) banks, using propensity score matching methodology. These findings have important policy implications and expand the existing knowledge on the consequences of banking supervision to guide banks’ behaviour, drive policy interventions and contribute to enhance supervisory effectiveness. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Depositors; Enforcement Actions; Event Study; Propensity Score","","","","","Poised for A Comeback Bank Deposits, (2012); Berger, Allen N., Do Depositors Discipline Banks and Did Government Actions During the Recent Crisis Reduce this Discipline?

The aim of this paper was to determine the mutual relationships between the research and development (R & D) resources, various indicators of scientific performance and the competitiveness of the sector. We carried out a cointegration analysis of a time series of R+D resources, the number of academic papers published, as well as patents and the competitiveness of this sector in various developed states. The econometric analysis of time series is built on panel cointegration models. Based on the combination of different comprehensive and coherent international databases and applying the latest methods of modern time series analysis, the paper proves that, in most developed countries, a direct, significant, causal, lagged relationship between the monetary resources allocated to R & D and the number of academic papers, as well as the number of patents can be observed. In most cases, a causal relationship can be demonstrated between the number of academic papers and patents, but vice versa, this fact is not provable. This study highlights the complexity of innovation systems in the pharmaceutical sector. The results prove only a weak connection between the number of patents and the number of publications. When evaluating the efficiency of the utilisation of resources allocated to pharmaceutical R+D, the effect of the time lag should be considered. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competitiveness; Economic Policy; International Statistics; Pharmaceutical Sector; Time Series Analysis; Cointegration Analysis; Competitiveness; Complexity; Econometrics; Economic Policy; Pharmaceutical Industry; Research And Development; Time Series Analysis","cointegration analysis; competitiveness; complexity; econometrics; economic policy; pharmaceutical industry; research and development; time series analysis","","","Author Contributions: J.O., A.K. and Z.L. conceived and designed the experiments.

The second part then addresses the functioning of global markets and investment decisions; more specifically it explores calendar anomalies, dependencies, overreaction effect, causality effect and stock returns volatility in South Asia, U.S. and global stock markets as a whole. Part three covers issues relating to capital structure, values of firm and investment strategies. Lastly, part four discusses emerging issues in finance like behavioral finance, Islamic finance, and international financial reporting standards.

Contrary to our initial expectations, findings show that trader credentials are more important than performance, volume, or risk signals, but there are significant differences between virtual and real money traders. This study proposes a network signaling theory approach by linking it to herd behavior and the disposition effect. Our findings can have practical implications not only for top traders, followers, and social trading platform managers but also for policy-makers and regulators of such investment instruments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Platforms; Investing; Leadership; Networks; Signaling Theory; Social Trading","","","","","Journal of Business, (1985); Ahlers, Gerrit K.C., Signaling in Equity Crowdfunding, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); Social Interaction and Investing Evidence Form an Online Social Trading Network, (2016); Arcot, Sridhar, Participating convertible preferred stock in venture capital exits, Journal of Business Venturing, 29, 1, pp. 72-87, (2014); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2018); Banerjee, Abhijit V., A simple model of heed behavior, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107, 3, pp. 797-817, (1992); Banerjee, Snehal, Signal or noise?

It offers a broad examination of the attributes and development of the ETF markets. The book presents a new approach to ETF markets modeling that uses innovation diffusion model. In addition, it explores the empirical links between ETFs and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The book also compares ETFs and competing investment options. This book should appeal to both academics and practitioners as it includes detailed descriptions of the ETF markets and prepared projections regarding their future development. As the Asia-Pacific region plays a significant role in the global economy, this book should be useful for international readers beyond this area. The Emergence of ETFs in Asia-Pacific begins with an overview of the Asia-Pacific economies, focusing on their importance for the global economy and their features. Next, the book introduces an analytical framework. It explains major features of ETFs (such as their creation, distribution, and trading) and key categories, which facilitates profound understanding of the book merit even for readers with little knowledge about ETFs. The following chapter explores the role of ICTs in economy and society identifying channels of their impact on financial markets. It discusses how ICTs foster dynamic spread of financial innovations (including ETFs) across financial markets. Next, the book examines the ETF market's development in different countries in the Asia-Pacific region, by analyzing their level of development in terms of turnover. In this part it also provides brief characteristics of all markets, including their structures and categories of ETFs in various countries. Consecutive part of the book is dedicated to reports on the process of ICTs growing penetration across Asia-Pacific countries, showing the changes observed during recent years. It then continues the empirical analysis of the ETF markets in the Asia-Pacific region by attempting to trace the links between the development of ETF markets and ICT penetration during the period 2004-2017.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the hand-collected data from firms listed on S&P BSE 500 from 2001 to 2016, this index comprises seven equally weighted sub-indices, comprising a total of 43 corporate governance attributes. This index and the sub-indices have further been regressed with the cost of equity of a firm. Findings: The results suggest a negative significant relationship between the overall corporate governance and the cost of equity. The study also suggests that among all the sub-indices, board composition predicts the cost of equity to a greater extent. Other than this, the audit committee sub-index has a negative significant association with the cost of equity. The findings imply that a well-governed firm enjoys ease of access to equity finance from the market. Originality/value: The corporate governance index is based on the recent regulatory reforms introduced in India. The index, with certain changes suitable to the local context, can be applied to similar emerging economies as well. The causal relationship tested using this method is the first one done in India.

Within the previous studies, to test the hypotheses, only the classical regression method is usually used and most of the times the effect of macroeconomic variables is not considered. In this study, in a new act for testing the hypotheses, three statistical methods are used, that is, classical regression models, mixed effects multilevel models and Bayesian multilevel models. Also in this study, the test of structural change is used to control the effects of macroeconomic variables, like inflation and other economic and political influence, on the results. Findings: The results of these three methods show that the effect of income smoothing and earnings quality on the relationship between tax avoidance and firm value are significant.

Design/methodology/approach: As pointed out by Raderbauer (2011), research and industry initiatives mainly focus on environmental measures while ignoring the economic and socio-cultural dimension of sustainability. Recognizing the importance of a holistic understanding to define sustainable business practices for the accommodation industry. Financial markets are no exception; moral and values either coming from secular or religious understanding help to examine relationships between attitudes and actions, as well as differences in attitudes and actions related to the business’ characteristics. In business, ethical considerations apply to a broad list of virtues that companies, their managers and employees customarily seek to adopt. These include, but are not limited to, the encouragement of honesty, integrity and efficiency, as well as diversity and communication skills. One of the most common sources of ethical considerations is religion. In these cases, religious doctrine imparts a sense of applied ethics, where one considers what right conduct is, how to live a life pleasing to the Divine and how one should treat him/herself and others in accordance with those teachings. Again, as ethical considerations is a broad philosophical concept, it can apply to any situation where the person ponders the nature of right and wrong, how to recognize the difference and the meaning those conclusions carry for everyday life. Findings: It can be concluded that the overall the quantitative and qualitative statistics showed that accommodation business manager’s decision has had a very little positive attitude toward sustainability and the implementation of sustainable business practices in ASE financial transaction, no matter what classification, type of business, ownership or size of business. Only rules and regulations govern the attitude and behavior when making financial transactions with profit is the main target. Moral indicators could not be seen throughout the analysis and test used to achieve objectives of the study at hand. One can imagine that the combined two factors together “Moral-Material” in implementing financial transactions will produce a more beneficial outcome. Achieving a material and holistic objective will produce an optimum situation, which can contribute positively to sustainable development. Originality/value: Islamic alternatives to traditional investment tools have been driven by the fact that such tools do not conform to the Islamic general principles of the Shari’ah (Usmani, 2002). There has been a growing desire to have funds in which profits are not based on riba or interest, which is prohibited in Islam. Muslims deem that profit should come because of efforts; this is not the case in interest-dominated investments. In addition, there is a desire to have investment portfolios, which are morally purified. Thus, investments in companies that are not in compliance with the Shari’ah are not permitted and are eliminated from the portfolio. To ensure compliance with the forgoing condition, Shari’ah advisory boards whose role is mainly to give assurance that money is managed within the framework of Islamic laws govern Islamic mutual funds (Hassan, 2001; Hassan, 2002). On the other hand, dealing with the applied part, the paper will deal with a case study from Jordan (Amman Stock Exchange), where, code of ethics is issued by virtue of the provisions of Article 26 (e) of the Securities Law No. 23 of 1997. The Amman Stock Exchange operates as an exchange for the trading of securities. The company lists securities such as equities and bonds. Its activities include providing enterprises with a means of raising capital by listing on the exchange; encouraging an active market in listed securities based on the determination of prices and trading; providing facilities and equipment for trading the recoding of trades and publication of prices; monitoring and regulating market trading; and coordinating with the Jordan Securities Commission as necessary. The company’s activities also include ensuring compliance with the law, fair market and investor protection; setting out and enforcing a professional code of ethics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amman Stock Exchange; Ethical Considerations; Investment Decisions; Islamic Financing; Moral Material Considerations","","","","","European Journal of Business and Management, (2013); Abel, Andrew B., Empirical investment equations.

Purpose of the article: This research extends the literature on personal finance by investigating the impact of both financial literacy levels and pension knowledge on employees’ investment choice decision for their retirement, while in previous literature the role of these factors has mainly been explored separately. Methods: To conduct the research, a survey questionnaire was applied to collect data in three main regions of Vietnam comprising Northern, Central and Southern Vietnam. Data collection was made in 2018, in which 427 valid questionnaires were used for data analysis from 700 questionnaires. Two estimation methods are employed for analysis in this study, including a linear probability model (LPM) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) model. The findings of this research remain significant after the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression model is used as an estimation technique to eliminate potential bias caused by endogenous problems. Finding & Value added: The results show that basic financial literacy level and pension knowledge are principal factors which significantly increase the probability of exercising retirement investment choice of employees, while advanced financial literacy level factor has a significant effect on choosing growth investing options for their retirement. Further, this research finds that there is no correlation between employees’ financial risk tolerance and their retirement investment choice. Furthermore, the study proposes and offers new evidence that pension knowledge is a decisive factor providing employees with encouragement to exercise retirement investment choice and those who consult with financial advisors tend to take part in growth investing option. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Advice; Financial Literacy; Investment Choice; Pension Knowledge; Retirement","","","","The authors are thankful to Ho Chi Minh City Open University for funding this research.

Overall, the results support the notion of a non-linear relation between managerial ownership and fund performance. Although the ownership by managers is more concentrated and significantly different in SMF, the positive relation is more pronounced in conventional fund. More importantly, the relation remains strong non-linear significantly and jointly determined by fund performance in a two-way relationship when endogeneity, simultaneity, and heterogeneity unobserved issues are considered.

This research studied the concentration of the top 10 shareholding ratios, change in reporting patterns, good corporate governance data by CGCODE guidelines, and economic performance of 200 listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand. The structural equation model was used as the research method. The results of this research indicated that an indirect influence of the shareholding structure on Economic Value Added (EVA) through good corporate governance report was not found. However, a positively direct influence of the shareholding structure on good corporate governance (CGCODE) was found with a statistical significance level of 0.5, with an influence coefficient of 0.04. In addition, good corporate governance (CGCODE) report has a direct influence on Economic Value Added (EVA) with a statistical significance level of.05 with the influence coefficient of 0.06. Therefore, it could be concluded that when the company has a more concentrated shareholding structure, the company will increase the strictness of good corporate governance.

The governance grades assessed by the Thai Institute of Directors are used as governance measurement for the analysis. The parameters estimated by Fama-Macbeth regression indicate that firms with higher governance ratings generate greater expected stock returns in a long run. However, on yearly basis, the positive relationship deteriorates and loses explanatory power in the most of the tested years. The coefficients of governance ratings estimated by fixed effect regression are examined for statistical difference, which confirms that effect of corporate governance on stock returns differs year by year. While there are some distinct years that governance ratings affect stock prices positively, higher governance ratings lead to lower returns in other particular years. The both positive and negative magnitudes of corporate governance's impact on expected returns do not stay the same over time.

Based on these phenomena, the aim of this study is to determine the factors that affect the company’s financial health. In order to achieve this aim, the present research will employ the purposive sampling method of seven SOEs with observations during the last 11 years. The data analysis employed involves the use of linear regression model and its management through software SPSS-Amos 23. As a result, the study found that subsidy is significant and negatively affects financial health, which means that the financial health of the SOEs is getting down when funding is still maintaining subsidy every year. Instead, financial health would be enhanced if the government limits the subsidies gradually and gives broad authority to decide on the pricing structure and control of resources to support the cost of efficiency. The study also found that firm size strengthens the link between subsidies to financial health with a positive coefficient and is exhibited significantly, which means that the larger the firm size, the stronger the effect of subsidies on the financial health SOEs. This means that the SOEs that have a good asset capability tend to have a better financial health, especially because efficient opportunities are supported by the control of resources and a more economical business scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Earnings Management; Financial Health; Subsidy","","","","","Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, The effect of capital structure on profitability: an empirical analysis of listed firms in Ghana, Journal of Risk Finance, 6, 5, pp. 438-445, (2005); Journal of Banking Finance, (2000); Paul, Asquith, Anatomy of Financial Distress: An Examination of Junk-Bond Issuers, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 109, 3, pp. 625-658, (1994); International Journal of Empirical Finance, (2014); International Journal of Business and Management, (2015); International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, (2017); Oida International Journal of Sustainable Development, (2016); Jurnal Kalibrasi Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi Garut, (2012); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

The paper is motivated based view where firms adjust to reach an optimal level of debt ratio as well as the agency problem arising from the separation of ownership and control leading to conflicting interests between managers and shareholders in order to maximize firm value, which could ultimately impede shareholders wealth maximization. Furthermore, the potential for conflict between controlling and minority shareholders are also captured in the appointment of directors linked to the state. The authors, therefore, evaluate the presence of state affiliated directors and their potential to compromise board independence, which may lead to sub-optimal financing decisions. Analyzing firms below target levels, the study finds that the presence of SAD allows firms below target levels to adjust at more rapid rates given the potential for favorable treatment while obtaining credit financing from financial institutions. Contrastingly, the findings, however, show that firms which exceed target leverage levels tend to adjust at more rapid rates in the absence of SAD on boards. The study results point towards the reluctance of these firms to raise financing in equity markets given the possible dilution of ownership of controlling shareholders as well as the reluctance to reduce debt levels. The findings are consistent regardless of measuring debt based on book or market values and across randomized measures of board composition implying that the presence of SAD alters the dynamics of the cost of capital and thus managerial financing decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Composition; Board Independence; Capital Ctructure; Randomized Tests; Speed Of Adjustment; State Affiliated Directors","","","","","Abdeljawad, Islam, The capital structure dynamics of Malaysian firms: timing behavior vs adjustment toward the target, International Journal of Managerial Finance, 13, 3, pp. 226-245, (2017); Hadi, Abdul Razak, Analyzing sectorial level determinants of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in asean, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 17, 2, pp. 7-17, (2018); Hadi, Abdul Razak, Capital structure determinants of shariah and non-shariah companies at bursa Malaysia, Opcion, 34, Special Issue 16, pp. 376-386, (2018); Hadi, Abdul Razak, Bank’s performance and its determinants – Evidence from middle east, Indian sub-continent and African banks, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 17, 1, pp. 17-26, (2018); Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, (2018); Abdullah, Shamsul Nahar, Board composition, CEO duality and performance among Malaysian listed companies, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 4, 4, pp. 47-61, (2004); Aguilera, Ruth, Global corporate governance: On the relevance of firms' ownership structure, Journal of World Business, 51, 1, pp. 50-57, (2016); Hashim, Hafiza Aishah, Board characteristics, ownership structure and earningsquality: Malaysian evidence, Research in Accounting in Emerging Economies, 8, pp. 97-123, (2008); International Journal of Economics Management, (2018); Bliss, Mark A., Political connection and cost of debt: Some Malaysian evidence, Journal of Banking and Finance, 36, 5, pp. 1520-1527, (2012)","","Czestochowa University of Technology ajanas@adm.pcz.czest.pl","","","","","","20817452","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059872567"

Three sets of alternatives to downsizing are available to companies suffering financial trouble: strategies addressing personnel/fix costs, strategies focused on addressing cost cutting/variable costs and strategies addressing strategic planning/revenue. Although alternatives to downsizing have been identified, little research has been conducted comparing the impact of downsizing vs alternatives to downsizing on firm performance. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This present study looked solely at strategies focused on addressing personnel/fix costs. Focusing primarily on forced attrition (downsizing) vs temporary attrition and/or natural attrition, this research attempts to determine whether specific groupings of alternatives to downsizing are more effective at addressing financial decline that companies find themselves in as compared to downsizing. This included relying on temporary attrition, natural attrition or doing nothing at all. Findings: The research presented here indicates that various alternatives to downsizing have an immediate positive impact on measures of profitability and a positive long-term impact on one measure of efficiency: revenue per employee. Evidence shows that temporary attrition leads to better financial outcomes than natural attrition than forced attrition or downsizing.

From the firms' perspective, the strategic choice to participate or not to participate in government subsidized RD projects affects its performance. Given the much-debated nature and in-practice importance, this study attempts to investigate the relationships among organizational resources and capabilities, strategic choice, and firm performance. The empirical study employs data from the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) for its timely verified financial data of listed companies in Taiwan. We analyze the behavior of Taiwanese high-tech firms in electronics and biotechnology industry while they consider applying for the RD subsidy from Industrial Technology Development Program (ITDP) sponsored by Taiwanese government. We examined the relationship between organizational resources and capabilities and the inclination towards the strategic choice of participating in the ITDP, and evaluated their respective performance with a control of endogeneity bias by implementing Heckman's two-stage estimation procedure. Our findings suggest that the tendency of the strategic choice to participate in government subsidized RD project is strongly correlated with a firm's absorptive capabilities. The strategic choice of participating or not to participating in ITDP in theoretically appropriate conditions is able to enhance firm performance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economics; Absorptive Capability; Biotechnology Industry; Economic Journals; Empirical Studies; Industrial Technology; Resources And Capabilities; Taiwanese High-tech Firms; Two-stage Estimations; Electronics Industry","Economics; Absorptive capability; Biotechnology industry; Economic journals; Empirical studies; Industrial technology; Resources and capabilities; Taiwanese high-tech firms; Two-stage estimations; Electronics industry","","","Accordingly, we attempt to explore the relationships among organizational resources and capabilities, strategic choice, and firm performance in this study.

The fundamental objectives of the ITDP are to support firms to submit to high-risk technology fields; to cultivate technologies with strong prospective for massive economic benefits; and to encourage industry-academia collaboration, generating knowledge spillover, ultimately leading to increased industrial competitiveness (Hsu et al., 2009). We also obtain data from nonparticipants by using Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ), which provided by Taiwan Economic Journal Co., is the most important and largest financial database in Taiwan, to compare the performance between these two groups.

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the U.K. government introduced austerity conditions which impacted firm CSR activities. From the initial sample of more than 250 firms, 50 consistently remain listed on the FTSE4good index during 2008–2012 and are analysed. The definition of CSR distinguishes voluntary and mandatory CSR construct. Findings indicate Board ownership structure and satisfactory firm performance impact on the level of voluntary CSR. Board ownership results suggest increased institutional and non-CEO shareholdings support a higher level of voluntary CSR engagement, whilst increased CEO shareholdings lead to a lower level of investment in voluntary CSR. In terms of satisfactory firm performance, results suggest positive attainment discrepancy supports a higher level of voluntary CSR, whereas greater potential organisational slack leads to a lower level of voluntary CSR investment. Effective governance and voluntary CSR association is more pronounced under conditions of high attainment discrepancy and low organisational slack. The findings suggest implications for adapting firm decision-making latitude and government policy between austerity and prosperity conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attainment Discrepancy; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Firm Performance; Organisational Slack; Ownership Structure; Sustainable Development; Corporate Social Responsibility; Decision Making; Financial Crisis; Firm Ownership; Government; Policy Strategy; Sustainable Development; United Kingdom","corporate social responsibility; decision making; financial crisis; firm ownership; government; policy strategy; sustainable development; United Kingdom","","","","Agrawal, Anup, Firm performance and mechanism to control agency problems between managers and shareholders, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 31, 3, pp. 377-397, (1996); J World Bus, (2015); Ahmed, Anwer S., Accounting conservatism and board of director characteristics: An empirical analysis, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 43, 2-3, pp. 411-437, (2007); Ajmal, Mian M., Conceptualizing and incorporating social sustainability in the business world, International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 25, 4, pp. 327-339, (2018); Romanian Economic Journal, (2013); Ali, Waris, Determinants of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Disclosure in Developed and Developing Countries: A Literature Review, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 24, 4, pp. 273-294, (2017); Al-Najjar, Basil, Environmental policies and firm value, Business Strategy and the Environment, 21, 1, pp. 49-59, (2012); Amato, Louis H., The effects of firm size and industry on corporate giving, Journal of Business Ethics, 72, 3, pp. 229-241, (2007); Amran, Azlan Bin, The influence of governance structure and strategic corporate social responsibility toward sustainability reporting quality, Business Strategy and the Environment, 23, 4, pp. 217-235, (2014); undefined, (2001)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","13504509; 17452627","","IJSDB","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044231493"

Along with linear causal relationship, the present study also attempts to uncover the effect of non-linearity on causal relationships based on Péguin-Feissolle and Teräsvirta (1999). The results indicate that risk-based explanation is more relevant for Sharia index return behavior in the emerging Indian stock market. This study reports significant relationship between macro variables and Sharia index returns. For Shariah indices, investor sentiments are more likely to affect short-term returns, i.e., high frequent timescales. However, we do not find significant sentiment pricing after controlling the effect of systematic risk factors in an asset-pricing framework.

While these developments do not amount to full-fledged RL, our findings have, first, implications for the assessment of institutional developments in Italy's political economy, providing evidence of increasing coordination against accounts, emphasizing stability or the disarticulation of existing institutional relations, and second, they qualify broader theoretical arguments on institutional change in national varieties of capitalism. Against standard arguments, the article suggests that increased competition can lead to tighter rather than looser coordination among economic actors. Finally, and more speculatively, the article presents some preliminary evidence that the commercial banks’ turn to RL might be contributing to the polarization of the Italian economy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Coordinated Market Economies; Corporate Governance; Financial Institutions; Italy; Mixed Market Economies; Polarization; Relationship Lending","","","","","Occasional Papers no 304, (2016); Banks Local Credit Markets and Credit Supply, (2010); Fragilita Finanziaria E Prospettive Di Crescita Financial Fragility and Growth Prospects Occasional Paper N 127, (2012); Comparing Financial Systems, (2000); L Industria, (2005); Amable, Bruno, The Diversity of Modern Capitalism, pp. 1-324, (2005); Nuove Strategie Delle Imprese Italiane, (2013); Economia E Politica Industriale Journal of Industrial and Business Economics, (2009); Relazione Annuale 2015 Annual Report 2015, (2016); Bollettino Statistico Statistical Bulletin","","Routledge info@tandf.co.uk","","","","","","14664526; 09692290","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048376853"

Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of 107 non-financial firms listed on the Saudi Arabia stock market over a ten-year period from 2004 to 2013. The authors use the generalized method of moments framework developed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998). In addition, for comparison purpose and as a robustness check, the present study uses other panel data techniques including fixed effects model, random effects model (and pooled ordinary least squares. Findings: The results reveal that there is a strong positive relationship between CSR (Zakat) and CFP. This suggests that Zakat contribute positively to both firm’s profitability and value and can be considered as a win-win strategy to maximize returns and improve performance while considering the society as a whole. The results are robust to alternative econometric estimation methods. Practical implications: The companies in Islamic economies can effectively and efficiently implement the basic Shari’a Law of paying Zakat, as a successful measure to implement CSR program, thus benefiting the society by narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, that, in turn, leads the company to achieve successfully its short-term as well as long-term goals and enhances the value of the firm in the market. Moreover, corporations are generally encouraged to adopt CSR because of its perceived benefits to both macro- and micro-performances. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first empirical study attempting to examine CSR-CFP relationship within Saudi context employing Zakat as a proxy for CSR. Additionally, the paper provides support for the stakeholder theory from an Islamic perspective. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Finance; Csr; Dynamic Panel Data; Financial Performance; Gmm; Saudi Arabia; Zakat","","","","","Abdullah, Naziruddin, The effectiveness of zakat in alleviating poverty and inequalities a measurement using a newly developed technique, Humanomics, 31, 3, pp. 314-329, (2015); Ackah, Charles Godfred, Trade, tariffs, growth and poverty, pp. 19-37, (2015); Agle, Bradley R., God and Mammon: The modern relationship, Business Ethics Quarterly, 9, 4, pp. 563-582, (1999); Waqf Based Microfinance Realizing the Social Role of Islamic Finance, (2007); Mohd Ali, Ahmad Fahme, The effectiveness of Zakat in reducing poverty incident: An analysis in Kelantan, Malaysia, Asian Social Science, 11, 21, pp. 355-367, (2015); Ali, Abbas J., Corporate Social Responsibility in Saudi Arabia, Middle East Policy, 19, 4, pp. 40-53, (2012); Ali, Isahaque, Zakat as a poverty reduction mechanism among the muslim community: Case study of Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia, Asian Social Work and Policy Review, 8, 1, pp. 59-70, (2014); Int J Appl Soc Sci Res, (2013); International Journal of Research Studies in Management, (2014); Ammann, Manuel, Corporate governance and firm value: International evidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 18, 1, pp. 36-55, (2011)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","03074358; 17587743","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046349905"

Design/methodology/approach: The fixed effect generalised least squares regression is used for the period from 2002 to 2014. Proxies for internal corporate governance are the size of the board, leadership structure, board activity, staggered board, boardroom independence, presence of key committees and board gender diversity. Value relevance is measured using the adjusted R2 derived from a regression of stock price on earnings and equity book values by following Ohlson’s accounting-based valuation framework. Findings: The findings suggest that the net asset value per share is value-relevant in South African listed firms and also when the boardroom is largely independent. The value of earnings per share (EPS) is more robust when corporate governance structures, such as separating the roles of chief executive officer and chairperson, proportion of board-independent board members and presence of board committees, are in place. This suggests that EPS favours agency and resource dependence theories. Practical implications: The value relevance of accounting information in the South African financial market underscores the importance of requisite rules and supervision regarding financial reporting to allow asset owners and managers in the allocation of capital decisions. This study supports the view that corporate governance plays a key role in ensuring, amongst others, credible financial reporting. The outcome of this study could inform the JSE to enforce, even stricter, compliance with IFRS and corporate governance to improve the value relevance of financial information. Social implications: Significant corporate governance reforms around the world suggest that regulators and policy makers consider corporate governance as a pertinent tonic in ensuring, amongst others, credible financial reporting. The implications of the study might assure users of financial information of how compliance to corporate governance practices may influence the value of the firm. This paper provides empirical evidence in the South African context that EPS, unlike net asset value per share, is driven by corporate governance structures. Originality/value: The period of this study is unique, because it covers a relatively stable economic period before the financial crisis, a challenging and unstable period of time when the financial crisis materialised, and the aftermath of the financial crisis. In addition, the examination period of the study also covers the two corporate governance reforms in South Africa, King II in 2002 and King III in 2009, as well as the new Companies Act No. 71 of 2008.

It is currently unknown how software ecosystem health affects the financial performance of open source companies. This is a problem, because open source is becoming increasingly popular and more knowledge is necessary for companies on how to capitalize on this phenomenon. Objectives. With this paper, insight is developed into the relation between software ecosystem health and financial performance of the open source company that nurtures it. Method. A case study on two open source companies, Cloudera and Hortonworks, is performed. The software ecosystem health and financial performance of both companies are assessed. Results. Cloudera is healthier in terms of robustness and niche creation, while Hortonworks is healthier in terms of productivity. Financially, Cloudera performs better than Hortonworks. Conclusion. The following hypotheses are formulated. Software ecosystem health has an expected positive relation with financial performance. Niche creation health is the main contributor to this relation, robustness health is a minor reason for this relation, and software ecosystem productivity health has little to no influence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Performance; Open Source Software; Oseho; Software Ecosystem Health; Ecosystems; Finance; Health; Open Systems; Productivity; Financial Performance; Open Sources; Oseho; Software Ecosystems; Open Source Software","Ecosystems; Finance; Health; Open systems; Productivity; Financial performance; Open sources; OSEHO; Software ecosystems; Open source software","","","","Mockus, Audris, Two case studies of open source software development: Apache and Mozilla, ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, 11, 3, pp. 309-346, (2002); Shah, Sonali K., Motivation, governance, and the viability of hybrid forms in open source software development, Management Science, 52, 7, pp. 1000-1014, (2006); Jansen, Slinger, Defining software ecosystems: A survey of software platforms and business network governance, pp. 13-28, (2013); van den Berk, Ivo, Software ecosystems: A software ecosystem strategy assessment model, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 127-134, (2010); Jansen, Slinger, Measuring the health of open source software ecosystems: Beyond the scope of project health, Information and Software Technology, 56, 11, pp. 1508-1519, (2014); Manikas, Konstantinos, Reviewing the health of software ecosystems - A conceptual framework proposal, CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 987, pp. 26-37, (2013); Carvalho, Iuri, HEAL ME - An Architecture for Health Software Ecosystem Evaluation, pp. 59-65, (2017); Towards an Interdisciplinary Socio Technical Analysis of Software Ecosystem Health, (2017); Hyrynsalmi, Sami, Wealthy, healthy and/or happy —what does ‘ecosystem health’ stand for?, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 210, pp. 272-287, (2015); Manikas, Konstantinos, Software ecosystems-A systematic literature review, Journal of Systems and Software, 86, 5, pp. 1294-1306, (2013)","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE)","ACM/IEEE 1st International Workshop on Software Health, SoHeal 2018, held in conjunction with the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE 2018","","Gothenburg","138311","02705257","9781450392266; 9780769528625; 9781450305761; 9781450305839; 1581132069; 9781450357401; 9798400705007; 9781605589701; 9781595934055; 9781595934079","PCSED","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051495383"

Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance structures of 391 Indian companies out of CNX 500 companies listed on National Stock Exchange have been studied for their impact on performance of companies. Structural equation modeling methodology has been employed on data for five financial years from 2010 to 2014 for selected companies. Market-based measure (Tobin’s Q) and accounting-based measure (return on asset) have been employed for measuring firm performance. Findings: Empirical findings indicate that there is significant positive association between board size and firm performance. Board independence is found significantly related to firm performance. Number of board meetings is found to be sending positive signal to the market creating firm value. Separation of CEO and chairman of the board is found to be value creating and overburdened directors affect firm performance adversely. Findings also suggest that the governance-performance relationship is also dependent upon the type of performance measures used in the study. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this study are in terms of data methodology and possible omission of some variables. It is understood that the qualitative dynamics happening inside board meetings impact corporate performance. The strategic decisions-making process adopted by the boards to fight competition or to increase market share is not available in public domain easily. The decision-making processes and monitoring for implementation of these decisions could impact corporate governance-performance relationship. These parameters and their impact on corporate performance are not covered under the scope of the present study. However, the same could have thrown more light on governance-performance relationship.

Specifically, we test the hypothesis of increasing environmentally responsible company behaviour in recent years. We do this by constructing environmental industry ratings based on a novel data-set covering three geographic regions and 42 industries from 2009 to 2015 and by fitting robust trend regression models to these ratings. Interestingly, we cannot observe a general upward trend in all industries and regions. In other words, the ‘green wave’ does not appear to carry all business sectors. This becomes particularly clear when looking at rankings derived from estimated trends. Industries in Europe show especially significant downward trends. Even though most European industries are currently rated higher than their counterparts in the Asia-Pacific region and North America, these trends indicate that Europe may lose this leading position in the future. Besides delivering such general tendencies, our estimated trends combined with the current rating levels provide important decision support. They show which industry sectors and regions are particularly (un)interesting for socially responsible investment products, ecologically conscious applicants or environmentally responsible consumers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Leaders; Environmental Ratings; Robust Regression; Trend Evaluation; Decision Support System; Environmental Management; Hypothesis Testing; Ranking; Regression Analysis; Stakeholder; Trend Analysis; Europe","decision support system; environmental management; hypothesis testing; ranking; regression analysis; stakeholder; trend analysis; Europe","","","","Aguinis, Herman, What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda, Journal of Management, 38, 4, pp. 932-968, (2012); Albertini, Elisabeth, Does Environmental Management Improve Financial Performance?

Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance structures of 391 Indian companies out of CNX 500 companies listed on National Stock Exchange have been studied for their impact on performance of companies. Panel data regression methodology has been used on data for five financial years from 2010 to 2014 for the selected companies. Performance measures considered are market-based measure (Tobin’s Q) and accounting-based measure (return on asset [ROA]). Findings: The empirical findings indicate that the market-based measure (Tobin’s Q) is more impacted by corporate governance than the accounting-based measure (ROA). There is a significant positive association between board size and firm performance. Board independence is found significantly related to firm performance. Number of board meetings is found to be sending positive signal to the market creating firm value. Separation of chief executive officer and chairman of the board is found to be value-creating, and overburdened directors affect firm performance adversely. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are in terms of methodology and possible omission of some variables. It is understood that the qualitative dynamics happening inside board meetings impact corporate performance. The strategic decision-making process adopted by the boards to fight competition or to increase market share is not easily available in public domain. The decision-making processes and monitoring for implementation of those decisions could impact corporate governance performance relationship. These parameters and their impact on corporate performance are not covered under the scope of the present study.

Hence, agency theory has been supported by findings of this study. Next finding of the study, i.e. separate positions of CEO and chairperson of the board positively associated with firm performance, is contrary to the stewardship theory. Positive association between size of the board and firm performance indicates support for resource dependency theory. Hence, the study supports agency theory and resource dependency theory.","Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, Corporate governance, ownership structure and performance of SMEs in Ghana: Implications for financing opportunities, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 7, 3, pp. 288-300, (2007); Adams, Renée B., Powerful CEOs and their impact on corporate performance, Review of Financial Studies, 18, 4, pp. 1403-1432, (2005); Adams, Renée B., Bank board structure and performance: Evidence for large bank holding companies, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 21, 2, pp. 243-267, (2012); Agrawal, Anup, Firm performance and mechanism to control agency problems between managers and shareholders, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 31, 3, pp. 377-397, (1996); Aguilera, Ruth, Corporate governance and director accountability: An institutional comparative perspective, British Journal of Management, 16, SPEC.

To understand the impact financial regulations have on reducing the financial fragility of banks we use the probability-of-default of banks as a proxy for bank failure. After analyzing data collected from 15 countries with a dual banking system for the period 2000–2015, we find convincing evidence that not all financial regulations have risk-reducing benefits for banks and the impact of financial regulations on default risk is not the same for conventional banks (CBs) and Islamic banks (IBs). The empirical evidence suggests that regulations that lessen overall default risk have a greater impact on IBs while those increasing default risk have a greater impact on CBs. Based on our findings we recommend that regulators should consider the different natures of CBs and IBs and tailor financial regulations to suit these operationally distinct financial intermediaries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Default Risk; Dual Banking System; Financial Regulations; Islamic Banking; Regulatory Framework","","","","Acknowledgements We would like to thank the Editor of the Journal of Regulatory Economics, and the anonymous referee for their helpful comments and suggestions that enabled us to improve the quality of this paper considerably.

At the moment, it is mostly practitioners that are driving the impact assessment process and its integration into investment and finance. Some academic research has been done on the consequences of consistent implementation of ESG standards and their value in de-risking assets, managing reputation and preventing damage to communities and environment, finally showing up in a better rating, lower operational risk or a higher good will. While this ex post perspective on consequences of leadership behaviour is useful, it does not provide management with a practical ex ante decision making tool, expanding decision making to integrate impact as a new decision making perspective. The ex ante decision support function of impact in opportunity recognition and scenario modelling has not been researched so far. Modelling of future fitness and positive impact creation ex ante will be a decisive market advantage in decision making. It is rational to assume that a positive impact driven approach will foster innovation, Yet the market has not entirely captured the upside potential of looking into positive impact creation as a decision making tool. Many authors stay with the ex post outcomes like creation of jobs or new consumption possibilities for customers when researching impact. Integrating impact into decision making is the new leadership tool because governments, charities, philanthropists alone are no longer capable of dealing with the twenty-first century’s social and environmental challenges. Focussing on the act of charitable giving belongs into the mindset of the twentieth century. The dependence on unpredictable funding hindered many charitable organizations from realizing their full potential concerning innovations, effectiveness and scale”. The dominant paradigm in financial markets today is the creation of financial returns solely and within the mindset of the twentieth century eco-social return is seen as sacrificing a certain amount of financial return. Although there is rich research that this trade-off is not true, it may still misalign impact investing with the principal—agent theory that posits that shareholder value is the indicator on how well the agent has managed the capital and ownership rights of the principal. This misinterpretation can be overcome with a growth and innovation mind-set that understands impact creation as an ex ante decision making tool and integrates in in all strategic decision making. This new leadership mind-set will foster not only impact but innovation and growth alongside and transform the logical constructs of mainstream investing and finance. Leadership focus on achieving and actively designing social outcomes as part of the business model aligns with the growth mind-set of the twenty-first century and is explored in this anthology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Accenture Sustainability Services, (2013); Ammann, Manuel, Corporate governance and firm value: International evidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 18, 1, pp. 36-55, (2011); Antadze, Nino, Impact Metrics for Social Innovation: Barriers or Bridges to Radical Change?, Journal of Social Entrepreneurship, 3, 2, pp. 133-150, (2012); Attig, Najah, Corporate Social Responsibility and Credit Ratings, Journal of Business Ethics, 117, 4, pp. 679-694, (2013); Shifting the Lens A De Risking Toolkit for Impact Investment, (2014); Barth, Mary E., Cost of capital and earnings transparency, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 55, 2-3, pp. 206-224, (2013); Harvard Business Review, (2014); Beiner, Stefan, An integrated framework of corporate Governance and firm valuation, European Financial Management, 12, 2, pp. 249-283, (2006); Benson, Bradley W., The Relation between Stakeholder Management, Firm Value, and CEO Compensation: A Test of Enlightened Value Maximization, Financial Management, 39, 3, pp. 929-964, (2010); Responsible Investment Banking, (2015)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","25228293; 25228285","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219016836"

During the 1980s, LBOs grew substantially in the US, and gradually spilled over to the UK. Between 1979 and 1989, the market capitalization of public-to-private (PTP) transactions in the US alone was in excess of $250 billion. One way of refocusing management’s attention on shareholder value creation is the LBO, in which an acquirer takes control of the firm in a transaction financed by funds borrowed against the target’s assets and/or cash flows. Three hypotheses underlie this claim: the incentive realignment hypothesis, the free cash flow hypothesis, and the control hypothesis. The control hypothesis suggests that shareholder wealth gains from going private largely result from an improved monitoring system imposed on the management team. While agency cost theory predicts these three distinct sources of wealth gains for LBOs, it may be difficult in practice to distinguish between these hypotheses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Acharya, Viral V., Corporate governance and value creation: Evidence from private equity, Review of Financial Studies, 26, 2, pp. 368-402, (2013); Journal of Political Economy, (1994); Aghion, Philippe, An Incomplete Contracts Approach to Financial Contracting, Review of Economic Studies, 59, 3, pp. 473-494, (1992); Agrawal, Ashwini K., Private Equity and Workers' Career Paths: The Role of Technological Change, Review of Financial Studies, 29, 9, pp. 2455-2489, (2016); Amess, Kevin, The impact of private equity on firms׳ patenting activity, European Economic Review, 86, pp. 147-160, (2016); Amess, Kevin, The wage and employment effects of leveraged buyouts in the UK, International Journal of the Economics of Business, 14, 2, pp. 179-195, (2007); Amess, Kevin, Leveraged buyouts, private equity and jobs, Small Business Economics, 38, 4, pp. 419-430, (2012); Leveraged Management Buyouts, (1989); Andrade, Gregor, How costly is financial (not economic) distress?

However, the empirical finding shows that not every capital investment has a significant positive effect on profitability. Literature indicates mixed results of examining the capital investment relationship with firm's profitability, which vary in respects to the debt structure. On the other hand, strong government reinforcement has pushed Malaysia up as one of the top ten countries with robust private capital investment in the year 2004. Since the capital investments are typically irreversible and hypothesized as profit generator, the first aim of this study is to examine the effect of the capital investment on the firm's profitability across firms and sectors. The second aim is to examine the moderating effect of capital structure on the relationship between capital investment and profitability across firms and sectors. This study utilized pooled ordinary least squares and fixed effect analysis across 708 nonfinancial Malaysian listed firms. The unbalanced datasets for the period 2001 to 2015 were employed to check the robustness of these results. This study suggested that capital investment has a strong significant positive effect on profitability measurements across Malaysian listed firms in nonfinancial sectors. On the other hand, the significant negative moderating effect of capital structure on the relationship between capital investment and return on capital across Malaysian listed firms reflected the perspective of empire building theory. In addition, the independent sample test engaged across sectors affirmed that moderating effect of capital structure are different across sectors. Thus, this study concluded the existence of moderating effect of capital structure on the relationship between capital investment and profitability. This study addressed the knowledge gap on the moderating effect of capital structure based on empire building theory. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Investment And Profitability; Capital Structure","","","","","Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, (1979); Financial Management, (2011); Woolridge, J.

These CSR benefits include an increase in stakeholders’ assessment of the corporation with a boost in perceived trustworthiness. Companies, however, may treat sustainability reports as a tool to legitimize their actions. In order to achieve the desired results from CSR activities, companies disclose only selected information to customers, employees and/or owners. The aim of this paper is to answer the question of whether companies change measures in subsequent CSR reports to avoid revealing unfavorable information in sustainability reports. We analyzed 116 reports of corporations from different countries: Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine and Latvia. We used the reports from the website: http://database.globalreporting.org/ For every company we used two newest reports for two consecutive years in the period 2010-2016. We used t-test to verify the hypothesis that companies remove and add the same number of CSR measures in subsequent reports and that corporations from controversial industries change disclosed information to higher extent than companies from other industries. We stated, that companies replace one measure with the new one to keep the impression of the same level of disclosure and to maintain or increase the level of legitimacy. Research showed that companies change the number and type of disclosed measures and they don’t explain reasons of the changes made in the reports, which may indicate a desire to green the organization by presenting only positive information. However, we can’t confirm that there is a significant difference in changes of CSR measures revealed between companies from controversial and non-controversial industries. The paper fills a research gap in the research on the reliability of CSR disclosure. It concentrates on the motives and the range of measures unveiled in the sustainability reports to legitimize a company’s activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Controversial Industries; Corporate Social Responsibility; Global Reporting Initiative; Indicators; Stakeholders","","","","","Barakat, Simone Ruchdi, The influence of corporate social responsibility on employee satisfaction, Management Decision, 54, 9, pp. 2325-2339, (2016); Borgers, Arian C.T., Stakeholder relations and stock returns: On errors in investors' expectations and learning, Journal of Empirical Finance, 22, pp. 159-175, (2013); Brammer, Steve J., Does it pay to be different?

The CEO-worker ratio in the cash compensation level of the top 100 largest publicly listed enterprises has risen to the level of 50-to-1 in 2014 from a level smaller than 15-to-1 before the year 2000. Against this background, a series of remuneration control policies have been announced in China by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and many other government departments. However, as a whole, the effects of such policies are rather poor. At present, nothing seems to catch Chinese corporations’ and even the Chinese economy’s attention like a threat to the pay and perks of the top executives and the closely related executive-employee compensation gap. On the one hand, the executive-employee compensation gap is getting larger with unlimited growth in China. On the other hand, there is still a huge research gap in the executive-employee compensation gap’s forming mechanisms and its consequences on various organizational outcomes in China. Given the above two facts, this book attempts to systematically investigate the antecedents and consequences of the executive-employee compensation gap from the perspective of corporate governance. To be specific, the investigated antecedents in this book include CEO age, CEO tenure, the independent directors, the board of supervisors, the CEO’s educational background, female executives, the CEO’s downward overstepping behavior and the CEO-employee discretion gap, while the investigated consequences of the executive-employee compensation gap include workplace territorial behavior, knowledge loss, employee turnover rate, individual innovative behavior and the firm’s future performance. The critical new findings of this book are shown as follows: (1) There is a positive relationship between the CEO’s age and the executive-employee compensation gap, and knowledge intensity can positively moderate such a relationship; (2) the CEO’s tenure can improve the enlargement of the executive-employee compensation gap in a nonlinear positive manner, and the CEOs with a longer tenure would enlarge the executive-employee compensation gap to the best degree with their self-served motivations; (3) the independent directors have the significant intention to enlarge the executive-employee compensation gap in Chinese listed manufacturing companies; (4) the board of supervisors has a direct negative effect on the executive-employee compensation gap, which is rather steady and significant, and it has various and unsteady moderating effects on the relationships between several critical corporate governance variables; (5) there is a cubic relationship between CEO educational attainments and the employees’ compensation, and there is a weak U-shaped relationship between CEO educational attainments and the executive-employee compensation gap; (6) the female executives have negative effects on the executive-employee compensation gap in Chinese listed manufacturing companies; (7) the downward overstepping behavior of the CEO has positive effects on the executive compensation gap, and the CEO’s downward overstepping behavior has positive effects on the executive-employee compensation gap; (8) the CEO-employee discretion gap has a much stronger positive effect on the executive-employee compensation gap than the effect that CEO discretion or employee discretion individually have; (9) the executive-employee compensation gap can determine the workplace territorial behavior via the mediating roles of psychological ownership, employee engagement, organizational citizenship behavior and the leader-membership exchange, while the effects are moderated by gratitude and trust; (10) the executive-employee compensation gap will be positively related to knowledge loss via the mediation effects of the leader-membership exchange and psychological ownership, while compensation communication can negatively moderate the positive relationship between the executive-employee compensation gap and knowledge loss; (11) there is an inverse U-shaped curve between the executive-employee compensation gap and the employees’ turnover ratio; (12) the executive-employee compensation gap has significant negative effects on the individual innovative behavior, which are partially mediated by the leader-membership exchange, psychological ownership and the sense of self-efficacy; and (13) technological intensity can positively strengthen the linkage between the executive-employee compensation gap and the firm’s future performance, and the positive pay-performance sensitivity strategy can improve the positive performance consequences of the executive-employee compensation gap.

Research Question: Using agency and resource dependency insights this paper examines first which type of firm-level antecedents trigger the adoption of OECD-type governance principles by Vietnamese listed firms at IPO. Subsequently this paper investigates whether the adoption of these governance principles leads to higher firm values at IPO and whether stricter governance is related to transparency after IPO. Research Findings: With respect to the antecedents of OECD-type governance in Vietnam this study finds that firms with foreign shareholders and younger firms adopt these governance principles. The adoption of stricter governance principles, especially in terms of strict supervisory board independence, as well as the appointment of directors with multiple director seats are beneficial for firm value at IPO. Governance transparency after IPO is unrelated to a firm's governance characteristics but positively associated with increasing firm size. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results show that agency insights are applicable in a context of concentrated ownership, low investor protection and weak enforcement, since stricter board independence leads to higher firm value. In addition resource dependence theory explains the choice of directors and provides evidence that boards with better network potential lead to higher firm value in this relationship-based emerging market.

We provide statistically significant evidence that, on average, investors have strongly negative reaction to layoff negotiations within the first 10 min. However, we also provide strong evidence that the first negative reaction is reversed by an upward post-drift in aggregated cumulative abnormal returns in the following hours, perhaps because markets need hours to process such unpredictable and complex information and its consequences—even if their first reaction was strong and immediate. Moreover, on the aggregated level, final layoff announcements do not generally convey information that is exceptionally useful to investors, except when reactions to associated initial announcements have not been statistically significant. Importantly, our analysis demonstrates the importance of the use of intra-day data: The reactions, which can be strong but short-lived, are identifiable with intra-day data only. Finally, we find that intra-day reactions cannot be explained by various company background characteristics, such as the number of employees, sales, profitability, and assets/liabilities ratio. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Abnormal Return; Announcements; Layoff; Stock Markets","","","","","Aït-Sahalia, Yacine, How often to sample a continuous-time process in the presence of market microstructure noise, Review of Financial Studies, 18, 2, pp. 351-416, (2005); Andersen, Torben G., VPIN and the flash crash, Journal of Financial Markets, 17, 1, pp. 1-46, (2014); Ball, Ray, How naive is the stock market's use of earnings information?, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 21, 3, pp. 319-337, (1996); Basu, S., INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF COMMON STOCKS IN RELATION TO THEIR PRICE‐EARNINGS RATIOS: A TEST OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS, Journal of Finance, 32, 3, pp. 663-682, (1977); Journal of Accounting Research, (1989); Bollerslev, Tim, ARCH modeling in finance.

The conclusion is argued from a study on a selected (and justified) sample of (182) companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and which use the same Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors Service Company (SBCR) assessment criteria, for their credit ratings, from 2010 to 2015. Practically, 3 debt ratios are examined in terms of 11 characteristic variables. Moreover, any relationship between credit rating and corporate governance can be thought to be an interesting finding. The relationship we find between credit rating and leverage is not as evident as that found by other researchers for different countries; it is significantly positively related to the outside director, firm size, tangible assets and firm age, and CEO and chairman office plurality. However, leverage is found to be negatively correlated with board size, profitability, growth opportunity, and non-debt tax shield. Credit rating is positively associated with leverage, but in a less significant way. CEO-Board chairship duality is insignificantly related to leverage. The non-debt tax shield is significantly correlated with leverage. The correlation coefficient between CEO duality and auditor is positive but weakly significant, but seems not consistent with expectations. Finally, profitability cause could be regarded as an interesting finding. Indeed, there is an inverse correlation between profitability and total debt (Notice that the result supports the pecking order theory). In conclusion, it appears that credit rating has less effect on the so listed large Chinese companies than in other countries. Nevertheless, the perspective of assessing credit risk rating by relevant agencies is indubitably a recommended time dependent leverage determinant. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Structure; Corporate Governance; Credit Rating; Large-listed Companies; Regression Analysis","","","","","Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, The effect of capital structure on profitability: an empirical analysis of listed firms in Ghana, Journal of Risk Finance, 6, 5, pp. 438-445, (2005); Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, Corporate governance and financing decisions of Ghanaian listed firms, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 7, 1, pp. 83-92, (2007); Agarwal, Yamini, Capital Structure Decisions: Evaluating Risk and Uncertainty, pp. 1-252, (2015); Ahmed, Naveed, Determinants of capital structure: A case of life insurance sector of Pakistan, European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences, 24, pp. 7-12, (2010); Sheikh, Nadeem Ahmed, Determinants of capital structure: An empirical study of firms in manufacturing industry of Pakistan, Managerial Finance, 37, 2, pp. 117-133, (2011); Sheikh, Nadeem Ahmed, Effects of corporate governance on capital structure: Empirical evidence from Pakistan, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 12, 5, pp. 629-641, (2012); Akhtar, Muhammad Farhan, Factors influencing the profitability of Islamic banks of Pakistan, International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 66, pp. 125-132, (2011); Journal of Economics and International Finance, (2013); European Journal of Business and Management, (2011); Country Specific Factors Related to Financial Reporting and the Value Relevance of Accounting Data, (1999)","","MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute support@mdpi.com","","","","","","22277099","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071379880"

The book critically assesses the ways in which interactions between different stakeholders in the venture capital ecosystem change (or ""deform"") venture capital, decreasing its value. Klonowski also reveals that venture capital actually has few benefits-and some outright disadvantages-for entrepreneurs, and it can create a self-perpetuating cycle of investment and loss for the entire venture capital industry.

The unprecedented financial boom stretching from the mid-1990s through 2008 ultimately led to the deepest recession in modern times and one of the slowest economic recoveries in history. It also resulted in the emergence of the draconian austerity policies that have swept across Europe in recent years. Property Boom and Banking Bust offers an expert insight into the complex property market dynamics that contributed to the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 and its devastating economic consequences. It is the first book to focus on a woefully underreported dimension of the crisis, namely, the significant role that lending on commercial property development played in the crisis. Among other key topics, the authors explore the philosophical and behavioral factors that propelled irresponsible bank lending and the property boom; how it led to the downfall of the banks; the impact of the credit crunch on the real estate industry generally in the wake of the financial crisis; the catastrophic effects the property bust had on property investors, both large and small; and how the financial institutions have sought to recover in the wake of the financial crisis. Provides valuable insights into what happened in previous booms and busts, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, and how they compare with the most recent one Offers an expert assessment of the consequences of the global financial crisis for the banking system and the commercial property industry Examines strategies banks have used to recover their positions and manage the overhang of indebtedness and bad property assets Addresses strategies the real estate industry have used to recover from the collapse in property values. Written in an accessible style, and featuring numerous insider case accounts from property bankers, Property Boom and Banking Bust disentangles the complex, tightly-woven factors that led to the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, while offering powerful lessons for property industry professionals on how to avoid having history repeat itself. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Consolidation and Merger Activity in the United States Banking Industry from 2000 Through 2010, (2012); undefined, (2015); Anderson, Keith, Speculative bubbles in the S&P 500: Was the tech bubble confined to the tech sector?, Journal of Empirical Finance, 17, 3, pp. 345-361, (2010); Delinquencies and Foreclosures Increase in Latest Mba National Delinquency Survey, (2007); undefined, (2013); Mortgage Finance Gazette, (2006); Failure of Hbos Plc Hbos, (2015); undefined, (2015); Stress Testing the Uk Banking System 2016 Results, (2016); Barras, Richard, Property and the economic cycle: Building cycles revisited, Journal of Property Research, 11, 3, pp. 183-197, (1994)","","Wiley Blackwell","","","","","","","9781119219200; 9781119219231","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050663176"

The results of SD and MV show that varying of calendar anomalies over time support the AMH in Islamic stock indices. The most vital finding is that the Islamic indices achieved greater efficiency over time, particularly during the recent financial crisis, when their prevalence greatly increased.

Such a model neglects to account for observed periods where firms experience large fluctuations due to uncertainty related to its R&D activities, external competitive or regulatory environments. Empirical evidence also shows that the behavior of these firms is difficult to describe – let alone predict – using this Gaussian process. With ambidexterity as a theoretical basis, we show that the value of HTSF can be statistically described as the result of a combination of two distinct random walks: an exploitative steady state component characterized by Neo-Marshallian equilibrium and low volatility; and a more dynamic component with high volatility reflecting bursts of large and rapid changes associated with Schumpeterian outcomes of explorative processes. A mixture of two normal distributions provides an overall function that is more reflective of the empirical evidence and provides a quantitative measure for the theory that firms engage in concurrent exploration/exploitation activities. A linear relationship between the two components of the mixture distribution that describe the stock value of these firms also emerges. By understanding this dual nature and its impact on stock value, firms can better manage resources and prepare for the increase in variability that are associated with exploration activities. A more accurate financial description of HTSF that reduces or that anticipates uncertainty may lead to financial tools and option pricing methods that put a premium on the value of HTSF markets, incentivizing investors to invest more in such firms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","The authors thank and acknowledge the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) for their support.

Stock performance is measured as the average monthly stock return for the period 1996-2001. The sustainability performance is measured both by an evaluation of the environmental or social risks of the industry to which a company belongs and by an evaluation of the environmental or social activities of a company relative to the industrial average. We apply two-stage econometric approaches, which include recent insights from empirical finance. The most important result is that a higher environmental sector performance has a significantly positive influence on the stock performance. In contrast, a higher social sector performance has a negative influence. This effect is somewhat less significant. The variables of corporate environmental and/or social activities relative to the industry average have no significant effect. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Common Risk Factors in Explaining Canadian Equity Returns, (2001); Blacconiere, Walter G., Environmental Information and Market Reactions to Environmental Legislation, Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance, 12, 2, pp. 149-178, (1997); Nachhaltige Aktienanlagen Eine Analyse Der Rendite in Abhangigkeit Von Umwelt Und Sozialkriterien, (1999); Environmental and Financial Performance are They Related, (1997); Davis, James L., Characteristics, covariances, and average returns: 1929 to 1997, Journal of Finance, 55, 1, pp. 389-406, (2000); Fama, Eugene F., The Cross‐Section of Expected Stock Returns, Journal of Finance, 47, 2, pp. 427-465, (1992); Fama, Eugene F., Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds, Journal of Financial Economics, 33, 1, pp. 3-56, (1993); Fama, Eugene F., Multifactor explanations of asset pricing anomalies, Journal of Finance, 51, 1, pp. 55-84, (1996); Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, (2006); Hamilton, James T., Pollution as news: Media and stock market reactions to the toxics release inventory data, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 28, 1, pp. 98-113, (1995)","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9781874719953; 9781351280525","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087678439"

But there are hot debates on whether CSR pays off, and how does CSR contribute to firm value remains unclear. The direct test of the relationship between CSR and firm value seems to be imprecise and spurious since it may be influenced by many indirect factors. This study aims to demonstrate whether corporate social responsibility is positively or negatively associated with firm value, and to specify the mechanisms of the relationship from a media attention perspective. The manufacturing industry in China provides the background for this study. To test the proposed hypotheses, data was gathered for manufacturing firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2013. Empirical results indicate that CSR performance is positively related to firm value, and that media attention has a mediating effect between CSR and firm value. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China; Csr Performance; Firm Value; Manufacturing Listed Firms; Media Attention","","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71202055; 71372064; 71431006), Innovative Research Group National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71221061), and Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 13jzd0016).

We investigate the determinants and consequences of the decisions made by French firms to use press releases in order to announce downsizing operations. We also examine whether the content of press releases has an impact on investor reactions to downsizing announcements. Particularly in the French context, downsizing operations reflect negatively on corporate social responsibility with respect to employees, and we anticipate that French managers will use disclosure strategies to counter a potential legitimacy threat. Our sample consists of 227 downsizing operations announced between 2007 and 2012 by 119 French listed firms. We find that the disclosure of press releases is driven by both contextual and legitimacy factors. We also find that press releases are associated with more negative reactions to downsizing announcements than when there is no press release, particularly in the case of proactive operations (i.e., implemented by firms with improving performance). A content analysis of press releases indicates that firms, on average, engage in a reactive impression management strategy in their disclosure that consists of attributing downsizing operations to external factors. Moreover, investors penalize the use of proactive arguments, particularly when they are used to justify proactive operations. Overall, our results show that, in the French case, disclosure strategies and their consequences on the financial markets relate to a legitimacy perspective. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disclosure Strategies; Downsizing Operations; Impression Management; Legitimacy Theory; Press Releases","","","","","Abraham, Steven Eric, Layoff announcements and employment guarantee announcements: How do shareholders respond?, International Journal of Manpower, 25, 8, pp. 729-740, (2004); Adams, Carol A., Corporate social reporting practices in western europe: Legitimating corporate behaviour?, British Accounting Review, 30, 1, pp. 1-21, (1998); Aerts, Walter, Media legitimacy and corporate environmental communication, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 34, 1, pp. 1-27, (2009); Arndt, Margarete, Presenting structural innovation in an institutional environment: Hospitals' use of impression management, Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, 3, pp. 494-522, (2000); Organization Science, (1990); Baboukardos, Diogenis, Value relevance of accounting information under an integrated reporting approach: A research note, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 35, 4, pp. 437-452, (2016); Ball, Ray, The effect of international institutional factors on properties of accounting earnings, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 29, 1, pp. 1-51, (2000); Barclay, Laurie J., Exploring the role of emotions in injustice perceptions and retaliation, Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, 4, pp. 629-643, (2005); Beattie, Vivien A., A methodology for analysing and evaluating narratives in annual reports: A comprehensive descriptive profile and metrics for disclosure quality attributes, Accounting Forum, 28, 3, pp. 205-236, (2004); Beelitz, Annika, Using discourse to restore organisational legitimacy: 'CEO-speak' After an incident in a German nuclear power plant, Journal of Business Ethics, 108, 1, pp. 101-120, (2012)","","Elsevier Inc. usjcs@elsevier.com","","","","","","02784254; 18732070","","JACPD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017408485"

First, the paper develops the theoretical framework for the potential sources of value creation from going private: a distinction is made between the reduction in agency costs, stakeholder wealth transfers, tax benefits, transaction costs savings, takeover defense strategies, and corporate undervaluation. The paper then reviews and summarizes whether and how these theories have been empirically verified in the four different strands of literature in LBO research. These strands of literature are categorized by phase in the LBO transaction: Intent (of a buyout), Impact (of the LBO on the various stakeholders), Process (of restructuring after the leveraged buyout) and Duration (of retaining the private status). Then, the paper shows that in the first half of the 2000s, a public-to-private LBO wave re-emerged in the US, UK and Continental Europe, whose value vastly exceeded that of the 1980s US LBO wave.

In doing so, this study considers CSR as a latent variable measured by environmental and social category scores of Thomson Reuters ESG. To overcome limitations of a single-equation regression analysis, structural equation modelling (SEM) is employed to investigate the relationship between CSR and firm value. Based on data of US companies from 2002 to 2016, this study demonstrates that traditional regression analysis produces inconsistent relationships between CSR and firm value. By contrast, SEM provides strong evidence in support of the positive CSR effect on firm value.

Motivated by these studies, this study examines the relationship between company scores (Corporate Governance Score, Economic Score, Environmental Score, and Social Score) and stock returns, both at portfolio-level analysis and firm-level cross-sectional regressions. In portfolio-level analysis, stocks are sorted based on each company scores and quintile portfolio are formed with different levels of company scores. Then, existence and significance of raw returns and risk-adjusted returns difference between portfolios with the extreme company scores (portfolio 10 and portfolio 1) is tested. In addition, firm-level cross-sectional regression is performed to examine the significance of company scores effects with control variables. While portfolio-level analysis results indicate that there is no significant relation between company scores and stock returns; firm-level analysis indicates that economic, environmental, and social scores have effect on stock returns, however, significance and direction of these effects change, depending on the included control variables in the cross-sectional regression. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Company Scores; Corporate Governance; Economic; Environmental; Social; Stock Return","","","","","Ammann, Manuel, Corporate governance and firm value: International evidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 18, 1, pp. 36-55, (2011); Aras, Güler, The Effect of Corporate Governance Practices on Financial Structure in Emerging Markets: Evidence from BRICK Countries and Lessons for Turkey, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 51, pp. S5-S24, (2015); Bali, Turan G., Macroeconomic risk and hedge fund returns, Journal of Financial Economics, 114, 1, pp. 1-19, (2014); Bali, Turan G., Maxing out: Stocks as lotteries and the cross-section of expected returns, Journal of Financial Economics, 99, 2, pp. 427-446, (2011); Bali, Turan G., The conditional beta and the cross-section of expected returns, Financial Management, 38, 1, pp. 103-137, (2009); Bhagat, Sanjai, Corporate governance and firm performance, Journal of Corporate Finance, 14, 3, pp. 257-273, (2008); Brown, Lawrence D., Corporate governance and firm operating performance, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 32, 2, pp. 129-144, (2009); Callan, Scott J., Corporate financial performance and corporate social performance: An update and reinvestigation, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 16, 2, pp. 61-78, (2009); Core, John E., Does weak governance cause weak stock returns?

Findings: The results revealed that organizational characteristics were found to have a significant positive impact on managers’ skill levels, and hard-to-fill vacancies caused by skills shortages were found in all types of organizations. Existing and deficient skills were also identified as affecting all organizations. Practical implications: The results suggest that organizations would benefit from the adoption of a system supporting internal retention, training and development and external recruitment to close the skills gaps.

A purposive sampling is used and data were collected from seven state-owned enterprises over the period of 2005 to 2016. The empirical evidence provided by this paper indicates that government subsidy has a significant negative impact on the financial strength, which means that the state-owned enterprises are difficult to manage the company independently if the government continues to provide subsidies or additional capital. This study also found that strategic profitability has a significant positive impact on the financial strength, which means there are opportunities for management to perform profitability practice of earnings management as strategic to enhance the level of financial strength of the company. However, capital structure is strengthening the relations of 'government subsidy' and 'real earnings management' with the financial strength. So far, it is still little known how 'capital structure' affects the relationship between government subsidy and financial strength, specifically in the case of state-owned enterprises. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Structure; Financial Indicators; Financial Strength; Government Subsidy; Strategic Profitability","","","","","Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, The effect of capital structure on profitability: an empirical analysis of listed firms in Ghana, Journal of Risk Finance, 6, 5, pp. 438-445, (2005); Predicting Financial Distress of Companies Revisiting the Z Score and Zeta Models, (2000); International Journal of Empirical Finance, (2014); International Journal of Business and Management, (2015); Oida International Journal of Sustainable Development, (2016); Journal Ssttgarut, (2012); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

Design/methodology/approach: Corporate governance structures of 391 Indian companies out of CRISIL NSE Index (CNX) 500 companies listed on national stock exchange (NSE) have been studied for their impact on performance of companies. Panel data regression methodology has been used on data for five financial years from 2010 to 2014 for the selected companies. Performance measures considered are market-based measure (Tobin’s Q) and accounting-based measure (return on assets [ROA]). Findings: The empirical findings indicate that market-based measure (Tobin’s Q) is more impacted by corporate governance than accounting-based measure. There is significant positive association between promoter ownership and firm performance. It is also indicated that the relationship between promoter ownership and firm performance is different at different levels of promoter ownership. Board size is found to be positively related to ROA; however, board independence is not found to be related to any of the performance measures. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are in terms of data methodology and possible omission of some variables.

This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Adams, Renée B., A theory of friendly boards, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 217-250, (2007); Addison, John T., Worker Directors: A German Product that Did Not Export?, Industrial Relations, 50, 2, pp. 354-374, (2011); Northwestern Journal of International Law Business, (2009); Aggarwal, Reena, Differences in governance practices between U.S. and foreign firms: Measurement, causes, and consequences, Review of Financial Studies, 22, 8, pp. 3131-3169, (2009); Aguilera, Ruth, Codes of Good Governance Worldwide: What is the Trigger?, Organization Studies, 25, 3, pp. 415-443, (2004); Aguilera, Ruth, Codes of good governance, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 17, 3, pp. 376-387, (2009); Anderson, Ronald C., Founders, heirs, and corporate opacity in the United States, Journal of Financial Economics, 92, 2, pp. 205-222, (2009); Anderson, Ronald C., Board characteristics, accounting report integrity, and the cost of debt, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 37, 3, pp. 315-342, (2004); Anderson, Ronald C., Founding-Family Ownership and Firm Performance: Evidence from the S&P 500, Journal of Finance, 58, 3, pp. 1301-1327, (2003); Anderson, Ronald C., Board composition: Balancing family influence in S&P 500 firms, Administrative Science Quarterly, 49, 2, pp. 209-237, (2004)","","Now Publishers Inc PO Box 1024 Hanover MA, 02339","","","","","","21645744; 21645760","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019047287"

We come up with a novel identification process and as such depart from mainstream socially responsible investing literature by concentrating on individual firms’ conduct and by studying a much wider range of issues. Firstly, we study the size and financial performance of fourteen potentially controversial issues: abortion, adult entertainment, alcohol, animal testing, contraceptives, controversial weapons, fur, gambling, genetic engineering, meat, nuclear power, pork, (embryonic) stem cells, and tobacco. We investigate an international sample of more than 1,600 stocks for more than twenty years. We then analyze the impact of applying negative screens to a market portfolio. Our findings suggest that the choice for negative screening strategies does matter for the size of the investment universe as well as for risk-adjusted return performance. Investing in controversial stocks in many cases results in additional risk-adjusted returns, whereas excluding them may reduce financial performance. These findings suggest that there are opportunity costs to negative screening. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Controversial Investments; Market Capitalization; Responsible Investing; Risk-adjusted Returns; Screening","","","","","Investing in Vice, (2004); Econometrica, (1993); Bassett, Gilbert W., Portfolio style: Return-based attribution using quantile regression, Empirical Economics, 26, 1, pp. 293-305, (2001); Baur, Dirk G., Stock return autocorrelations revisited: A quantile regression approach, Journal of Empirical Finance, 19, 2, pp. 254-265, (2012); Ad Astra, (2005); Cai, Ye, Doing Well While Doing Bad?

Despite theoretical and empirical progress in understanding the mechanisms behind strategic decision making in family firms, there is still no strategic management theory for family firms. To address this gap, we adapt the dynamic capabilities approach to family firms by developing a theoretical model that attempts to serve as a framework for helping family firms in the strategic decision making process. The model is based on the concept of familiness and family learning mechanisms (knowledge accumulation, integration, codification and socioemotional wealth preservation) suggesting that the interplay of the two impacts on the efficient strategic management of family firms.

In these kinds of markets, information is an invaluable asset. However, with the modernization of the financial transactions and the information systems, the large amount of information available for a trader can make prohibitive the analysis of a financial asset. In the last decades, many researchers have attempted to develop computational intelligent methods and algorithms to support the decision-making in different financial market segments. In the literature, there is a huge number of scientific papers that investigate the use of computational intelligence techniques to solve financial market problems. However, only few studies have focused on review the literature of this topic. Most of the existing review articles have a limited scope, either by focusing on a specific financial market application or by focusing on a family of machine learning algorithms. This paper presents a review of the application of several computational intelligent methods in several financial applications. This paper gives an overview of the most important primary studies published from 2009 to 2015, which cover techniques for preprocessing and clustering of financial data, for forecasting future market movements, for mining financial text information, among others.

As such, decision-making processes based on Financial data have been a popular topic in industries. However, analyzing Financial data is a non-trivial task due to large volume, diversity and complexity, and this has led to rapid research and development of visualizations and visual analytics systems for Financial data exploration. Often, the development of such systems requires researchers to collaborate with Financial domain experts to better extract requirements and challenges in their tasks. Work to systematically study and gather the task requirements and to acquire an overview of existing visualizations and visual analytics systems that have been applied in Financial domains with respect to real-world data sets has not been completed. To this end, we perform a comprehensive survey of visualizations and visual analytics.

The most distinctive feature of IMFs lies in screening strategies based on the application of Shariah (Islamic law). Conventionally, this involves the application of exclusionary screening, whereby fund managers screen out companies involved in certain activities, including riba (interest), gharar (uncertainty), and maysir (gambling), and prohibited products from their portfolios as prescribed by the Quran, Sunnah and related Islamic texts. The central outcome is that the managers of IMFs, unlike those of conventional mutual funds (CMFs), necessarily access only a subset of the population of investments available. This has dramatic implications for many conventional dimensions of mutual fund behavior, including performance, the flow of funds, and the fund selection behavior of investors. This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature relating to mutual fund performance, screening, and fund flows. The literature on performance starts with a discussion of the development of mutual fund performance evaluation techniques and the underlying theory. This provides a general understanding of the importance of performance measurement and various ways to measure mutual fund performance. In addition, this chapter also reviews the literature on fund attributes and their influence on mutual fund performance. In the screening literature, the review includes the impact of screening and differences in screening strategies to firm and mutual fund performance. Finally, the chapter reviews the literature concerning the behavior of mutual fund investors, which uses mutual fund flows as the proxy. In the area of mutual fund investors, we specifically focus on how Islamic mutual funds (IMFs) investors make fund selection decision and examine if these investors are able to select funds that are able to earn positive returns in subsequent period. Overall, the literature on IMFs is still scarce and lags behind compared with the literature on the conventional mutual funds (CMFs) and socially responsible investment (SRI) funds. Thus, this section reviews related theoretical and empirical studies on SRI screened and unscreened funds to draw the necessary bases for the study of IMFs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Performance of Islamic Equity Funds A Comparison to Conventional Islamic and Ethical Benchmarks, (2008); Abdullah, Fikriyah, Investigation of performance of Malaysian Islamic unit trust funds: Comparison with conventional unit trust funds, Managerial Finance, 33, 2, pp. 142-153, (2007); Abdullah, Nur Atiqah, THE performance of Malaysian unit trusts investing in domestic versus international markets, Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, 5, 2, pp. 77-100, (2009); Journal of Business, (1985); Flows Performance and Managerial Incentives in Hedge Funds, (2004); Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, (2008); Academy of Management Journal, (1978); Journal of Investing, (1997); International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, (2007); Barber, Brad M., Out of sight, out of mind: The effects of expenses on mutual fund flows, Journal of Business, 78, 6, pp. 2095-2119, (2005)","","Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","","","","","","","9781536106596; 9781536106336","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021924814"

Among the symptoms is the fact that the Voice and Text Services provided by Telcos have been challenged heavily by the emerging of data-driven services that has been absorbed almost instantly by the crowd. This phenomenon amplifies the understanding that the business must run for the low-margin Digital Business and says farewell to high-margin Legacy Portfolios. The stakeholders would be satisfied if business brings profit and can shows some degrees of sustainability. The company is now need to secure their new Portfolio or creates another brand new one with manageable Margins and Values. Regarding the phenomenon, Telcos is now needed to define a model that could ensure Value-Pertaining-and-Leveraging stances especially in their Digital Portfolios meanwhile maintaining their cashcows. This research aimed to build such a model by exploring the effect of Product, Funding Management and Stakeholders Assurance to Business Valuation both directly or through ""Digital Death Valley"" by using Quantitative and Creative Problem Solving Method. While Quantitative method calculates the effects of variables and generate the foundation of the solution, the Creative Problem Solving methods explore alternatives that can be built to achieve the objective. Data sample collected from 30 Legal Entities of Telkom Group between 2013 - 2016. That is the period when early Digital transformation took place in Telkom Group. Quantitative run showed that Product is the most influencing factor to Digital Business Valuation followed by funding Management and Stakeholders Assurance. The Conclusion suggests that Digital Death Valley must be suppressed to the lowest level not only because it's direct impact to the profitability calculation but also affect long term Enterprise Value as Digital Death Valley comprises of Commitments, Concept Alteration and Partnership Strategy as Dimensions. By considering the relationship between variables a model called ""Strategic Threshold Canvas"" is suggested to oversee New Digital Business Portfolio initiatives that can be run by Business Analyst unit in Telcos. Essentially this model suggest a new Company Policy and Chain of Business Processes Standard that can be enacted to achieve Digital Glory. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","""valley Of Death""; Business Valuation; Digital Product; Funding Management; Stakeholder Assurance","","","","","Andriessen, Daniel, IC valuation and measurement: Classifying the state of the art, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 5, 2, pp. 230-242, (2004); Sustainable Business Performance Through Competitive Strategy and Company Reputation Development Based on Value Creation and Industry Competitive Forces, (2016); Bae, Jaekwon, Product development with data mining techniques: A case on design of digital camera, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 8, pp. 9274-9280, (2011); Blank, Steve, Why the lean start-up changes everything, Harvard Business Review, 91, 5, (2013); Case Studies in Finance Managing for Corporate Value Creation, (2003); Chandrashekaran, Murali, Estimating Contagion on the Internet: Evidence from the Diffusion of Digital/Information Products, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 24, 1, pp. 1-13, (2010); Research on Telco Cost Optimization, (2016); Product Capital Model Modeling the Value of Design to Corporate Performance, (2005); Startup Valuation by Venture Capitalist A Strategic Management Approach, (2003); Gupta, Sudheer, Building and transforming an emerging market global enterprise: Lessons from the Infosys journey, Business Horizons, 57, 2, pp. 169-179, (2014)","","Allied Academies support@alliedacademies.org","","","","","","19396104; 15441458","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006141234"

Development of medicine and a better quality of life have caused population aging which is particularly noticed in the developed countries. The problem of an aging population has encouraged scientists and practitioners to actively discuss the issue of social security. Particularly, the importance of a changing pension system has become a concern in regards of ensuring the public welfare. Therefore, the article analyses the sustainability of Lithuania II pillar pension funds using multi-criteria methods. The carried out research has enabled the evaluation and comparison of II pillar pension funds and their performance. The use of multi-criteria methods combining a few funds' actions defining indicators into a whole have helped to evaluate the pension funds. In addition, it has helped to identify the funds' operational sustainability and to choose the best fund, emphasizing the most important aspects for each member and shaping the weights of multi-criteria methods' evaluation. It is important to emphasize that the aspect of reward indicator is significant in the asset accumulation in pension funds because the goal of these funds is to accumulate the biggest amount of asset for the future pension in a long period and not just to protect the money from its depreciation. Finally, it is worth mentioning that this type of a research provides a new perspective on the pension funds' evaluation in the context of other criteria. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-criteria Analysis; Multi-criteria Decision Making; Pension Fund","","","","","Amir Shah, Syed Muhammad, Performance evaluation of mutual funds in Pakistan, Pakistan Development Review, 44, 4 PART II, pp. 863-874, (2005); Adami, Roberta, An empirical analysis of the performance of pension funds: Evidence from UK, Studies in Economics and Finance, 31, 2, pp. 141-155, (2014); Alda, Mercedes, Performance of Spanish pension funds: Robust evidence from alternative models, Applied Financial Economics, 23, 4, pp. 297-314, (2013); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2009); Andruškevičius, Algirdas, Evaluation of contractors by using COPRAS-the multiple criteria method, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 11, 3, pp. 158-169, (2005); Antucheviciene, Jurgita, Measuring congruence of ranking results applying particular MCDM methods, Informatica (Netherlands), 22, 3, pp. 319-338, (2011); Artikis, George P., Performance evaluation: A case study of the Greek balanced mutual funds, Managerial Finance, 29, 9, pp. 1-8, (2003); Averting the Old Age Crisis, (1994); Mutual Funds Performance Appraisal Using A Multicriteria Decision Making Approach Financial Engineering Laboratory Department of Production Engineering Management Technical University of Crete, (2011); Economics and Rural Development, (2012)","","General Jonas Zemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania manuela007756@gmail.com","","","","","","20297017; 20297025","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994389339"

Design/methodology/approachA dynamic panel data model with generalized methods of moments (GMMs) technique has been deployed to estimate the relationship between R&D intensity and performance. Arellano and Bond (1991) estimation methodology has been used to generate the estimates. A sample of 55 publicly listed firms operating in the Indian pharmaceutical industry for the period 2005-2014 has been considered. FindingsThe study finds moderate to heavy profit persistence in the Indian pharmaceutical industry. The study also finds that there exists a positive relationship between R&D intensity and performance for the Indian pharmaceutical Industry. The results hold even after considering two separate measures of profitability – return on assets and return on sales. The results also hint at a possible non-linear relationship between R&D intensity and profitability. Research limitations/implicationsThe results highlight positive profit persistence among pharmaceutical firms. The results also highlight the need for a sustained investment in R&D, as its benefits are driven in the long run. Thus, managers should devise proper policies R&D investments. Also, prospective entrants should properly study the existing entry barriers before deciding upon the mode and timing of entry. Originality/valueThe degree of profit persistence and the dynamic nature of relationship between R&D intensity and firm performance in the Indian pharmaceutical sector has not been studied.

The individual chapters provide a detailed analysis of various classes of alternative investments on the financial market. Despite many different definitions of alternative investments, it can be assumed that a classical approach to alternative investments includes hedge funds, fund of funds (FOF), managed accounts, structured products and private equity/venture capital. Alternative investment in keeping with this broad definition is the subject of consideration here. The theoretical part of each chapter is meant to collect, systematize and deepen readers’ understanding of a given investment category, while the practical part of each focuses on an analysis of the current state of development of alternative investments on the global market and outlines the prospects of future market development.

The two types of EM proxies are case studies (firms with three fraudulent activities) and econometric estimation of regression residuals (of revenues and accrual functions). The two investment proxies are industry-adjusted investment and investment function residuals. Considering that outliers are common in panel data but are often ignored in estimation, the aforementioned proxies are determined with and without considering the outliers using listed companies in China from 1998 to 2010.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the findings of a thorough literature review identifying the drivers, interpretations, definitions and results which management accounting scholars have associated with cost consciousness. Findings - This paper has synthesized the definitions and interpretations by considering their conceptual broadness and the subjects that cost consciousness characterizes. In addition, various potential drivers of cost consciousness have been identified where management control systems play a major role. Also, this paper summarizes both the positive and negative outcomes which scholars seem to expect from an increase of cost consciousness. Research limitations/implications - Given that no prior work has focused on the conceptual development of cost consciousness, it was necessary to infer most of the interpretations, drivers and results which management accounting scholars have associated to the cost consciousness notion. Originality/value - Cost consciousness is a concept that appears in hundreds of peer-reviewed articles on management accounting. However, only a handful of management accounting scholars have defined or evaluated this concept to a certain degree. As a result, what management accountants believe cost consciousness to be, how it is driven and what result may be expected from it, is nowhere to be found in any synthesized manner.

It is current in that it includes many of the most up-to-date and notable deals (e.g., Facebook's takeover of WhatsApp, the Dell privatization, and Verizon's mega buyout of Vodafone's share of Verizon Wireless), precedent setting judicial decisions (e.g., efforts to overturn defenses at Airgas and Sotheby's), new regulations (e.g., expediting backend mergers), trends (e.g., increasing role of activist investors in takeovers), and new tactics (e.g., two-tiered poison pill) employed in M&As. Most integrative case studies are new for this edition and involve transactions that have been announced or completed since 2013. It is comprehensive in that nearly all aspects of M&As and corporate restructuring are explored. It is cutting edge in that conclusions and insights are anchored by the most recent academic research, with references to more than 200 empirical studies published in leading peer-reviewed journals just since 2012. And the substantially updated content is illustrated with numerous practical exhibits, case studies involving diverse transactions, easy-to-understand numerical examples, and hundreds of discussion questions and practice exercises. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, (2007); Board Directors and Experience A Lesson from Private Equity, (2010); Adams, Renée B., A theory of friendly boards, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 217-250, (2007); Strategy and Business, (2006); Differences in Governance Practices Between U S and Foreign Firms Measurement Causes and Consequences, (2007); Financial Management, (1990); undefined, (2008); Agrawal, Ankur, When big acquisitions pay off, McKinsey Quarterly, 3, pp. 103-108, (2011); Agrawal, Anup, The Post‐Merger Performance of Acquiring Firms: A Re‐examination of an Anomaly, Journal of Finance, 47, 4, pp. 1605-1621, (1992); Agrawal, Anup, Insider trading in takeover targets, Journal of Corporate Finance, 18, 3, pp. 598-625, (2012)","","Elsevier","","","","","","","9780128013908","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016902675"

Seen as being inevitable in an increasingly competitive global marketplace, the high levels of downsizing activity attest to the deep-seated belief among managers that downsizing enhances organizational efficiency and leads to improved financial performance. Critics, on the other hand, argue that benefits are illusory and point out that attendant costs, both visible and invisible, can make downsizing a relatively ineffective tool for creating firm value. After a brief discussion of the factors that motivate and propel firms to engage in downsizing, we, in this article, examine the findings of extant research to assess whether downsizing does indeed improve organization performance. What we find based on our examination of 55 studies is that the findings are equivocal with very little agreement among researchers on the efficacy of employee downsizing to create organizational value. We explore possible reasons for the same and conclude by providing directions for future research that, we believe, will provide the insights that scholars and managers need to better understand the complex relationship between employee downsizing and firm value. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Announcement Date; Japanese Firm; Market Return; Psychological Contract; Wealth Effect","","","","","Abraham, Steven Eric, The market reaction to layoff announcements: A union-nonunion comparison, International Journal of Manpower, 27, 5, pp. 452-466, (2006); Ahmadjian, Christina L., Safety in numbers: Downsizing and the deinstitutionalization of permanent employment in Japan, Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, 4, pp. 622-654, (2001); Armstrong-Stassen, Marjorie, Coping with transition: A study of layoff survivors, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 15, 7, pp. 597-621, (1994); Atanassov, Julian, Labor and corporate governance: International evidence from restructuring decisions, Journal of Finance, 64, 1, pp. 341-374, (2009); Downsizing in America Reality Causes and Consequences, (2003); Brauer, Matthias F., Workforce downsizing and firm performance: An organizational routine perspective, Journal of Management Studies, 51, 8, pp. 1311-1333, (2014); Brockner, Joel, Why it's so hard to be fair, Harvard Business Review, 84, 3, pp. 122-130, (2006); Brookman, Jeffrey T., CEO cash and stock-based compensation changes, layoff decisions, and shareholder value, Financial Review, 42, 1, pp. 99-119, (2007); Cagle, Julie A.B., Inter-industry differences in layoff announcement effects for financial institutions, Journal of Economics and Finance, 33, 1, pp. 100-110, (2009); University of Auckland Business Review, (2002)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","2192810X; 21928096","","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961210972"

However, a major part of this sector, the airline industry, deals with many negative impacts, such as air pollution, noise, CO2 emission, and labor practice. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a strategic business activity that can enhance the sustainability of the airline industry. The results of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) reveal that airlines of Western countries exhibit a more remarkable CSR performance than Asia-Pacific airlines, suggesting that the CSR programs of Asia-Pacific airlines need improvement. By constructing an evaluation hierarchy and applying the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method, this study found that the key strategic factors in the airline industry's implementation of CSR include corporate governance, risk and crisis management, brand management, and product responsibility (safety). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Dematel; Sustainable Development Airline Industry","","","","","Chang, Yuchung, Evaluating the performance of Chinese airports, Journal of Air Transport Management, 31, pp. 19-21, (2013); Wang, Qi, Evaluating corporate social responsibility of airlines using entropy weight and grey relation analysis, Journal of Air Transport Management, 42, pp. 55-62, (2015); Lee, Seoki, Financial impacts of socially responsible activities on airline companies, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Research, 34, 2, pp. 185-203, (2010); Chen, Fangyuan, Customer perceptions of airline social responsibility and its effect on loyalty, Journal of Air Transport Management, 20, pp. 49-51, (2012); Cowper-Smith, Allan, The adoption of corporate social responsibility practices in the airline industry, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 19, 1, pp. 59-77, (2011); Searcy, Cory, Corporate sustainability ratings: An investigation into how corporations use the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Journal of Cleaner Production, 35, pp. 79-92, (2012); Sustainability Yearbook, (2015); G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, (2015); undefined, (2015); undefined, (2015)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84934324895"

How CEOs are compensated thus can be conceptualized as a valuation process of how boards view the value of CEOs' human capital. Two types of human capital - international experience and political ties - have emerged as potential drivers of CEO compensation during institutional transitions. But how they impact CEO compensation has remained unclear. We develop a resource dependence-based, contingency framework to focus on the external and internal factors that enable or constrain human capital to impact CEO compensation. Because of the tremendous regional diversity within China, externally, we focus on the level of marketization of the region in which firms are headquartered. Internally, we pay attention to two corporate governance mechanisms: politically connected outside directors and compensation committee. Data from 10,329 firm-year observations at 94 per cent of listed firms in China largely support our framework. Overall, our study contributes to resource dependence research by extending this research to the context of institutional transitions with a focus on how human capital impacts CEO compensation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo Compensation; Human Capital; Institutional Transitions; International Experience; Political Ties; Resource Dependence","","","","","Aguilera, Ruth, An organizational approach to comparative corporate governance: Costs, contingencies, and complementarities, Organization Science, 19, 3, pp. 475-492, (2008); Spatial Econometrics Methods and Models, (1988); Bai, Chongen, Incentives for CEOs with multitasks: Evidence from Chinese state-owned enterprises, Journal of Comparative Economics, 33, 3 SPEC.

This study is the first to theorize and empirically examine the relationship between the magnitude of workforce downsizing and firm performance applying an organizational routine perspective. Consistent with prior research on organizational routines, we posit that small-scale downsizing leads to efficiency improvements without disrupting the existing routines. While larger routine disruptions occur in both medium- and large-scale downsizing, we further argue and find that large-scale downsizing tends to be more beneficial than medium-scale downsizing. Building on prior research on routines, we reason that in medium-scale downsizing employees try to salvage the impaired, partially functioning routines, while large-scale downsizing requires a more fundamental rethinking and re-creation of routines leading to more positive outcomes. Our study contributes to downsizing research through the application of the organizational routine perspective to explain the financial outcomes of downsizing. In doing so, we depart from the widely held assumption in the downsizing literature that the relationship between the magnitude of downsizing and firm performance is linear. Our study also extends prior research on organizational routines by highlighting the usefulness of conceiving routines as mindful accomplishments where the pressure to engage in path-breaking cognitive effort may lead to better results than path-dependent repairing of routines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Firm Performance; Organizational Routines; Workforce Downsizing","","","","","Adler, Paul S., Flexibility Versus Efficiency?

Compared to conventional investors who are not restricted in their choice of funds, Islamic investors are restricted to investing in shari’a-compliant funds, thus giving up some diversification benefits. The possibility of international diversification among only Islamic funds may thus help Islamic investors to invest in accordance to their religious beliefs and still benefit from diversification. Design/methodology/approach – The paper assesses the benefits of diversification by analyzing the extent of co-integration among four regional Islamic funds and by estimating the short-term and long-term structural dynamics of and among these funds. The paper uses an Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to testing the long-run relationships among these funds and use variance decomposition and impulse response functions to examine the structural dynamics of the relationship between these funds. These methods can also be used for predictive purposes and represent, in authors opinion, a useful approach that complements the traditional methodology of static covariance matrix to find the efficient frontier at a given moment in time. Findings – The results indicate that international diversification can help reduce risk if Asia Pacific Islamic funds and MENA region Islamic funds are invested contemporaneously and/or Asia Pacific Islamic funds and North America Islamic funds, and/or Europe funds and MENA funds. The paper also finds that investors would benefit from investing in North American funds and MENA funds both in the long run and in the short run. Conversely, the paper finds that Europe funds and North American funds are co-integrated in the long-run precluding the opportunity for substantial diversification benefits from these particular portfolio mixes. Research limitations/implications – The long-run analysis helps passive fund managers and investors in composing their portfolio by providing evidence that some portfolio mixes of different regional Islamic funds lead to better risk return performance than one regional Islamic fund portfolios. The short-run analysis however helps the active fund managers and investors as it suggests that diversifying in the short run and reviewing their portfolio on a regular basis would be beneficial as well. Originality/value – This analysis justifies the promotion of Islamic finance as the negative correlation between several Islamic funds across the regions studied suggests better opportunities of investments via international diversification making Islamic funds more desirable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-integration; Diversification Benefits; International Diversification; Islamic Funds; Market Integration; Shari’a Compliant Investment; Variance Decompositions","","","","","Performance of Islamic Equity Funds A Comparison to Conventional Islamic and Ethical Benchmarks, (2008); Abdullah, Fikriyah, Investigation of performance of Malaysian Islamic unit trust funds: Comparison with conventional unit trust funds, Managerial Finance, 33, 2, pp. 142-153, (2007); Baca, Sean P., The Rise of Sector Effects in Major Equity Markets, Financial Analysts Journal, 56, 5, pp. 34-40, (2000); Baele, Lieven, Time-varying Integration and International diversification strategies, Journal of Empirical Finance, 16, 3, pp. 368-387, (2009); Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen, German monetary unification and the stability of the German M3 money demand function, Economics Letters, 66, 2, pp. 203-208, (2000); International Journal of Business and Economics, (2002); Co Integration Error Correction and the Econometric Analysis of Non Stationary Data, (1993); Bekaert, Geert, International stock return comovements, Journal of Finance, 64, 6, pp. 2591-2626, (2009); Berger, Dave, International diversification with frontier markets, Journal of Financial Economics, 101, 1, pp. 227-242, (2011); Brooks, Robin, The rise in comovement across national stock markets: Market integration or IT bubble?, Journal of Empirical Finance, 11, 5, pp. 659-680, (2004)","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach-The evaluation is based on a literature review of the wind power industry and policy issues in selected countries, patent and financial analyses of leading European firms and semi-structured interviews of energy experts. Findings-The results reveal that the industry is policy-driven and appropriate energy politics are crucial in continuing the rapid wind power market diffusion during the next decades. Wind power technologies are in an accelerating stage of evolution, and competitive technologies contribute to market diffusion and firms’ financial performance. However, without adequate energy subsidies and emission trading schemes, the industry will not be competitive in the energy markets, where other energy sources, including fossil fuels, are also subsidized. Research limitations/implications-This case focuses mainly on the leading European industry actors and has a European perspective in policy issues. The analyses are limited to the main support mechanisms and countries where the diffusion of renewable energy has been rapid. Practical implications-The wind power industry is still in the emerging phase in its life cycle, and well-planned and efficiently implemented public support schemes are needed in order for the firms to compete successfully in the markets. The industry will probably be competitive without subsidies in 10-20 years. Originality/value-The evaluation of the given indicators and political environment will give insight into the competitive environment and factors behind the diffusion of emerging technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Change; Energy Policies; Financial Analysis; Patent Analysis; Renewable Energy; Wind Power","","","","","Ács, Zoltán J., Innovation and firm size in manufacturing, Technovation, 7, 3, pp. 197-210, (1988); Ács, Zoltán J., Innovation, firm size and corporate finance.

The realities of global poverty and the inequalities between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ are clear and well documented, and the gaps between world’s richest and the world’s poorest are ever-increasing. But, even though funding development is assumed to be key, the relationship between finance and development is contested and complex. This book explores the variety of relationships between finance and development, offering a broad and critical understanding of these connections and perspectives. It breaks finance down into its various aspects, with separate chapters on aid, debt, equity, microfinance and remittances. Throughout the text, finance is presented as a double-edged sword: while it is a vital tool towards poverty reduction, helping to fund development, more critical approaches remind us of the ways in which finance can hinder development. It contains a range of case studies throughout to illustrate finance in practice, including, UK aid to India, debt in Zambia, Apple’s investment in China, microfinance in Mexico, government bond issues in Chile, and financial crisis in East Asia. The text develops and explores a number of themes throughout, such as the relationship between public and private sources of finance and debates about direct funding versus the allocation of credit through commercial financial markets. The book also explores finance and development interactions at various levels, from the global structure of finance through to local and everyday practices. Global Finance and Development offers a critical understanding of the nature of finance and development. This book encourages the reader to see financial processes as embedded within the broader structure of social relationships. Finance is defined and demonstrated to be money and credit, but also, crucially, the social relationships and institutions that enable the creation and distribution of credit and the consequences thereof. This valuable text is essential reading for all those concerned with poverty, inequality and development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Capital Rules the Construction of Global Finance, (2007); Abouharb, M.

We find that accounting no longer plays such a strong stewardship role, certainly for the venture capital investor.

Firms with high corporate reputation are better able to sustain superior performance. During the financial crisis, the corporate reputation of financial institutions has decreased resulting in a bad perception of the financial sector by the public. However, improving their corporate reputation is of major importance for financial institutions as they are heavily dependent on the trust of the market participants. Thus, managing the public perception about a financial institution is of critical importance. Therefore, firms can deploy organizational impression management tactics to influence how the public perceives them. In this research, we obtained data from 54 corporate Twitter accounts of 36 financial institutions broadcasting more than 21,000 messages between October 2012 and June 2013 to the public. Thereby, we combine two former separately discussed theories in a single research approach and examine which organizational impression management tactics can be identified based on the social media messages regarding corporate reputation.

Such firms are seldom able to invest in lengthy and expensive development processes, which suggests that they may frequently rely instead on other pathways to generate innovativeness within the firm. In this paper, we develop and test arguments that ""bricolage,"" defined as making do by applying combinations of the resources at hand to new problems and opportunities, provides an important pathway to achieve innovation for new resource-constrained firms. Through bricolage, resource-constrained firms engage in the processes of ""recombination"" that are core to creating innovative outcomes. Based on a large longitudinal dataset, our results suggest that variations in the degree to which firms engage in bricolage behaviors can provide a broadly applicable explanation of innovativeness under resource constraints by new firms.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper compares the market timing and stock selection abilities of 159 mutual funds listed on the Saudi Arabian stock market from 2007 to 2011 by using the CAPM regression and Treynor and Mazuy models. The paper addresses the benchmark problem from which most prior IMFs studies suffered by using appropriate regional benchmarks. As a robustness check, coefficients of IMFs and conventional funds are compared by using the differences in mean and standard deviation analysis obtained from the standard CAPM model on individual funds. Findings – The empirical results show evidence of better performance of IMFs relative to conventional funds during periods of economic crisis. In addition, although there is no evidence of relative superiority in market timing ability, managers of IMFs appear to have better stock selection ability during times of economic crisis. Research limitations/implications – The combination of superior stock selection ability of IMFs and the negative market timing ability of conventional funds suggest that IMFs offer better hedging opportunities for investors during periods of economic downturn. Practical implications – The findings of this paper suggest that IMFs can provide hedging benefits during adverse economic conditions – an issue of great importance due to the current and forecast insecurity surrounding the global capital markets. By holding a portion of their investment portfolio in IMFs, investors can experience a higher degree of confidence in terms of investment security, growth and returns.

At its core lies the concept that commodity risk management decisions require an in-depth understanding of speculative strategies, and vice versa. The book offers readers a unified treatment of important concepts and techniques that are useful in applying derivative securities in the management of risk in commodity markets. While some of these techniques are well known and fairly common, Poitras offers applications to specific situations and links to speculative trading strategies-extensions of the material that not only are hard to come by, but helpful to both the academic and the practitioner. The book is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the general framework for commodity risk management, the second part focuses on the use of derivative security contracts in commodity risk management, and the third part deals with applications to three specific situations. As a textbook, this book is designed to appeal to classes at a senior undergraduate/MBA/MA levelof training in Finance, financial economics, actuarial science, management science, agriculturaleconomics and accounting. There will also be interest for the book as: A monograph for research libraries, a handbook for individuals working in the commodity risk management industry, and a guidebook for those in the general public interested in topics like farm risk management or the assessment of hedging practices of publicly-traded commodity producers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Ackermann, Carl, The performance of hedge funds: Risk, return, and incentives, Journal of Finance, 54, 3, pp. 833-874, (1999); Acs, Szvetlana, Effect of yield and price risk on conversion from conventional to organic farming, Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 53, 3, pp. 393-411, (2009); Adam, Tim René, Do Firms Use Derivatives to Reduce their Dependence on External Capital Markets?, Review of Finance, 6, 2, pp. 163-187, (2002); Adam, Tim René, Hedging, speculation, and shareholder value, Journal of Financial Economics, 81, 2, pp. 283-309, (2006); Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, (2008); Adam, Tim René, Financial constraints, competition, and hedging in industry equilibrium, Journal of Finance, 62, 5, pp. 2445-2473, (2007); Adam-Müller, Axel F.A., The impact of delivery risk on optimal production and futures hedging, European Finance Review, 7, 3, pp. 459-477, (2003); Financial Management, (1984); Adler, Nicole, Hub-and-spoke network alliances and mergers: Price-location competition in the airline industry, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 41, 4, pp. 394-409, (2007); Federal Provincial Crop Insurance Program an Integrated Environmental Economic Assessment, (1998)","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","9780415879293; 9781136262616","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904949195"

This is true for the public at large, of corporations, of hedge funds, of regulatory authorities, of treasury chiefs and, of course of students and academics who take keen interest in analyzing the behaviour of stock prices. Stock price movements are nowadays part of the background of all our lives. Although not a perfect indicator, stock markets tend to predict recessions as they fluctuate with economic activity. Over the past three decades developing countries have expanded stock markets owing to the obvious benefits that they deliver. In Africa, the number of stock markets increased from only six before 1989 to 21 by 2004, and currently 24.

Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on 19 interviews of employees affected by job loss. The interviewees were employees in a case organization that had implemented a HR practice called the ""Competence pool"" as an alternative to layoffs. Findings: Although contract breach occurs, alternative HR arrangements can mitigate the negative effects of job loss for the affected employees and help restore the psychological contract. Such arrangements have to be implemented with care in order to avoid injustice perceptions. Research limitations/implications: As HR arrangements are by nature unique and company-specific, this study is limited by its focus on one organization and national context. It however provides future directions for research on layoffs and their consequences. Practical implications: By exploring how the affected employees perceive an alternative to layoffs, this study has several implications for organizations interested in managing layoff pressures with alternative HR arrangements. Originality/value: By investigating the experiences and perceptions of employees whose jobs were terminated but whose employment relationship continued under specific conditions, this study provides new insights into layoff and HR literatures from psychological contract and justice perspectives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Case Studies; Contracts Of Employment; Employees; Finland; Human Resource Management; Layoffs; Organizational Justice; Psychological Contract Breach; Unemployment","","","","","Academy of Management Journal, (1999); Bastien, David T., Corporate judo: Exploiting the dark side of change when competitors merge, acquire, downsize, or restructure, Journal of Management Inquiry, 5, 3, pp. 261-275, (1996); Benson, George S., Employee development, commitment and intention to turnover: A test of 'employability' policies in action, Human Resource Management Journal, 16, 2, pp. 173-192, (2006); Research on Negotiation in Organizations, (1986); Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Attitudes in and Around Organizations, (1998); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1987); Brockner, Joel, Perceived control as an antidote to the negative effects of layoffs on survivors' organizational commitment and job performance, Administrative Science Quarterly, 49, 1, pp. 76-168, (2004); Chang, Eunmi, Distributive justice and organizational commitment revisited: Moderation by layoff in the case of Korean employees, Human Resource Management, 41, 2, pp. 261-270, (2002); Chaudhry, Anjali, A Sensemaking Model of Employee Evaluation of Psychological Contract Fulfillment: When and How Do Employees Respond to Change?, Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 45, 4, pp. 498-520, (2009)","","","","","","","","02683946","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868539871"

This is unsettling for managers because these studies contain little effort to develop a framework for understanding the relationship. To examine this unnerving potential, we develop and test a theoretical model that explains how dynamic capability mediates the impact of intellectual capital on performance. In this study, the scope of intellectual capital includes human capital, relational capital and structural capital. This study examines the pooled data of 242 high-technology firms from 2001 to 2008. Results from Bayesian regression analysis suggest that the effect of structural capital on performance is completely mediated by dynamic capability. Furthermore, the findings show that dynamic capability does not completely mediate the respective effects of human capital and relational capital on performance, but does so only partially. These results provide convincing support for the importance of dynamic capability through accumulating R&D and marketing capability over time, thereby enhancing firm performance. The empirical findings and the ensuing discussion will be of interest to managers and practitioners. © 2010 The Author(s).

Large, established firms have become experts at implementing best practices as a way to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of costly R&D. Yet in practice, relying upon these routine paradigms can create inertia for these firms. The purpose of our study was to conduct research on the innovation strategies used within start-ups and to show how large firms can start ''thinking small.'' With an eye towards what established firms can learn from start-ups, we investigated over nine years the innovative practices of small ventures. We found that successful, new firms use certain best practices in unique ways. They innovated with '' hyper-agility'' and implemented 1) small omnifunctional teams with no functional boundaries, 2) goal-driven rapid development of technology rather than process guided methods, and 3) instinctive exploration of market potential rather than quantitative analysis. We highlight several of these successful new ventures and provide a framework for R&D managers of large firms and discuss how the entrepreneurial approaches of their smaller counterparts can coexist within their existing innovation processes. © 2012 IEEE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Large Firms; New Ventures; R&d Teams; Small Firms; Start-ups; Entrepreneurship; Large Firms; New Ventures; Small Firm; Start-ups; Innovation; Management; Industry","Entrepreneurship; large firms; New ventures; Small firm; Start-ups; Innovation; Management; Industry","","","","Pdma Foundation New Product Development Report of Initial Findings Summary of Responses from 2004 Cpas, (2004); Adams, Renée B., Understanding the relationship between founder-CEOs and firm performance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 16, 1, pp. 136-150, (2009); Ahuja, Gautam, Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 6-7, pp. 521-543, (2001); Almeida, Paul, The Exploration of Technological Diversity and the Geographic Localization of Innovation, Small Business Economics, 9, 1, pp. 21-31, (1997); Antoncic, Bostjan, Alliances, corporate technological entrepreneurship and firm performance: Testing a model on manufacturing firms, Technovation, 28, 5, pp. 257-265, (2008); Journal of Marketing Research, (1994); Innovation and Industry Evolution, (1995); Balachandra, Ramaiya, Factors for success in r&d projects and new product innovation: a contextual framework, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 44, 3, pp. 276-287, (1997); Barczak, Gloria J., Perspective: Trends and drivers of success in NPD practices: Results of the 2003 PDMA best practices study, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 26, 1, pp. 3-23, (2009); Ben-Arieh, David H., Activity-based cost management for design and development stage, International Journal of Production Economics, 83, 2, pp. 169-183, (2003)","","","","","","","","15580040; 00189391","","IEEMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860179581"

Sustainable technologies, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, are increasingly becoming part of our daily life. This dissertation fills the ensuing gap by providing an insight into the emerging German greentech industry, one of the largest in the world. It develops an integrated and interdisciplinary theoretical framework in which to assess the relationships between innovation, growth and financing from a firm-level perspective; it then tests this framework empirically. In essence, the study finds that: (1) Innovative activity and corporate growth depend heavily on the availability of capital. At the same time, it appears that particularly innovative firms are more likely to face financial constraints. (2) A lack of funds is very apparent for around a quarter of the firms investigated and seems most severe in the early part of the growth state, where firms focus on commercializing existing products. (3) Government support programs only partially offset these effects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Finanz Betrieb Aufsatze, (2006); Ács, Zoltán J., Innovation and firm size in manufacturing, Technovation, 7, 3, pp. 197-210, (1988); Ács, Zoltán J., Introduction: Entrepreneurship and economic development, Regional Studies, 38, 8, pp. 871-877, (2004); Corporate Lifecycles how and Why Corporations Grow and Die and What to do about It, (1988); Agarwal, Rajshree, Firm and Product Life Cycles and Firm Survival, American Economic Review, 92, 2, pp. 184-190, (2002); Agarwal, Rajshree, The conditioning effect of time on firm survival: An industry life cycle approach, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 5, pp. 971-994, (2002); Akerlof, George A., The market for “lemons”: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Free Market Environmentalism, (1991); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); Economic Welfare and the Allocation of Resources for Invention, (1962)","","Gabler Verlag","","","","","","","9783834936011; 9783834936004","","","English","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026697142"

The improvement is based on the use of feedforward neural networks to calculate the RSI in a more accurate way, which we call the iRSI. This new tool will be used in two scenarios. In the first, it will predict a market - in our case, the Spanish IBEX 35 stock market. In the second, it will predict single-company values pertaining to the IBEX 35.

Richard K. Lenz analyses how LBOs evolve after the financial investors have exited. Based on three case studies of former LBOs in Germany, he shows that performance decline is often related to the weakening of the former performance-enhancing series of governance instruments. The author reveals that management starts to over-emphasize growth while improvements on the micro-level of the company are robust and allow outperforming competitors. Finally, he concludes that performance decline seems to be rather due to inconsistent interests and less monitoring by new shareholders than to wealth transfer towards financial investors. © Gabler | GWV Fachverlage GmbH, Wiesbaden 2010.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample under investigation consists of a set of Spanish companies, which downsized between 1995 and 2001. The paper includes downsizing announcements and combines information from two different datasets (BARATZ and SABI). The focus is placed on the size of downsizing and the use of disengagement incentives. Findings: A negative relationship between the size of downsizing and post-downsizing corporate performance is found. In particular, firms which announced severe downsizing experience relatively lower performance in the year following the announcement. Originality/value: The analysis advances organizational research by reinforcing the concept that firm performance is not only contingent on strategies, but also influenced by the means through which these strategies are implemented. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Downsizing; Financial Performance; Organizational Performance; Organizational Restructuring; Spain","","","","","Ahmadjian, Christina L., Safety in numbers: Downsizing and the deinstitutionalization of permanent employment in Japan, Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, 4, pp. 622-654, (2001); Allen, Tammy D., Survivor reactions to organizational downsizing: Does time ease the pain?, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 74, 2, pp. 145-164, (2001); Appelbaum, Steven H., The realistic downsizing preview: A management intervention in the prevention of survivor syndrome (part I), Career Development International, 5, 7, pp. 333-350, (2000); Barber, Brad M., Detecting abnormal operating performance: The empirical power and specification of test statistics, Journal of Financial Economics, 41, 3, pp. 359-399, (1996); Strategic Management, (1993); Academy of Management Journal, (1992); Budros, Art, The mean and lean firm and downsizing: Causes of involuntary and voluntary downsizing strategies, Sociological Forum, 17, 2, pp. 307-342, (2002); New Organizational Reality Downsizing Restructuring and Revitalization, (1998); Cameron, Kim S., Strategies for successful organizational downsizing, Human Resource Management, 33, 2, pp. 189-211, (1994); Academy of Management Executive, (1991)","","","","","","","","00251747","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956395708"

The book empirically explores the phenomena of corporate social responsibility (CSR), restructuring, and relationships with firm's performance in China. It gives an insight into how Chinese firms respond to expectations of stakeholders by making social goals a part of their overall business operations. It also gives a fresh view of the new concept of socially responsible restructuring.

Fifty financial ratios are selected to predict the direction of one-year-ahead earnings changes. A Bagging technique is introduced to improve the classification accuracy of decision tree.

The improvement in performance remains significant after controlling for persistence in bank performance. A comparison of the performance of privatized banks in developed and developing countries suggests that privatization has encouraged excessive risk taking among privatized banks in developing countries, with the consequence that those banks carry large non-performing assets than their counterparts in the developed countries.

Solutions are provided from the operational level up to strategic planning and are capable to support every choice in the strategy portfolio, from cost to quality and flexibility. IT systems in the manufacturing and operational level were analyzed extensively in literature: ERP systems, computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and so forth. According to Wong, Bo, Bodnovich, and Selvi (1997), 53.5% of the reviewed literature in artificial intelligence refers to applications in production and operations management. Nevertheless, the second most important area for advanced IT applications is that of finance (25.4%). This research will be focused on the common set of the two previously mentioned areas: production management and the necessary financial tools. Production and operation management requires specific financial tools in order to accomplish the functions of production planning, costing, investment appraisal, and so forth. Computational intelligence in those financial functions is mostly needed for the production operation department and for the production operation strategy. Specifically, the weight will be put on information technology automation of financial functions adopted by production departments: forecasting production needs, production planning and control, profit volume analysis, cost analysis, investment appraisal analysis, and so forth. An attempt will be made to classify the various quantitative and qualitative techniques in relation to various financial aspects. Specifically, advances of neural networks, expert systems, advanced statistical analysis and operational research methods, and various hybrid techniques will be presented in relation to financial models applied in production. Financial applications will be analyzed according to their modules and their outputs in a strategic alignment concept. Finally, a strategic alignment model will be derived for the adoption of financial applications in businesses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Computer Aided Manufacturing; Costs; Enterprise Resource Planning; Investments; Operations Research; Production Control; Competitive Advantage; External Environments; Financial Applications; Financial Tools; Investment Appraisal; It System; Operational Level; Production And Operations Management; Production Operations; Strategic Weapons; Competition; Computer Aided Design","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided manufacturing; Costs; Enterprise resource planning; Investments; Operations research; Production control; Competitive advantage; External environments; Financial applications; Financial tools; Investment appraisal; IT system; Operational level; Production and operations management; Production operations; Strategic weapons; Competition; Computer aided design","","","","Abernethy, Margaret A., Management control systems in research and development organizations: The role of accounting, behavior and personnel controls, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 22, 3-4, pp. 233-248, (1997); Abernethy, Margaret A., The role of professional control in the management of complex organizations, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 20, 1, pp. 1-17, (1995); Ahn, Byeong Seok, Integrated methodology of rough set theory and artificial neural network for business failure prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 18, 2, pp. 65-74, (2000); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Baker, Malcolm P., Appearing and disappearing dividends: The link to catering incentives, Journal of Financial Economics, 73, 2, pp. 271-288, (2004); Financial Management, (1980); Bennell, Julia A., Modelling sovereign credit ratings: Neural networks versus ordered probit, Expert Systems with Applications, 30, 3, pp. 415-425, (2006); Intelligent Systems in Accounting Finance and Management, (2004); Bentz, Yves, Neural networks and the multinomial logit for brand choice modelling: A hybrid approach, Journal of Forecasting, 19, 3, pp. 177-200, (2000); Bergerson, Karl, A commodity trading model based on a neural network-expert system hybrid, pp. 289-293, (1991)","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9781605666785; 9781605666778","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014711853"

Then, taken a step further, statistical analysis surprisingly revealed that firms that cut the highest proportions of their workforce had a significant deterioration of their operational indebtedness and a non-significant change of their labour productivity.

Charlene, Department of Accounting, University of Arkansas, Stuttgart, United States","We investigate a sample of cross-border mergers involving US firms that acquired foreign targets between 1985 and 1995. Our general interest is in the long-term success of the acquisitions, measured by the post-merger abnormal returns to the US acquirers. Our primary focus is the relationship between the quality of the foreign target's accounting disclosures and the acquisition's long-term success. Employing a procedure recommended by Lyon et al. (1999), we find that US acquirers in cross-border mergers experience significantly negative long-term abnormal returns post-merger. These returns also are significantly more negative than those realized by a matched sample of US acquirers that acquired US targets. To investigate the potential association between the US acquirers' post-acquisition returns and target firms' accounting disclosures, we classify the merger transactions by target firm home country. We define variables to reflect the quality of accounting disclosures and control for other important country-specific features. The results reveal that post-merger abnormal returns are less negative for acquirers of targets based in countries where accounting data is less value relevant. This may be due to a higher cost of capital for target firms in these countries, resulting in a built-in discount in the pricing of targets. An examination of the premiums paid in a subset of 79 cross-border mergers reveals evidence consistent with this contention: premiums are lower for target firms based in countries where accounting data is less value relevant. These results suggest that shareholders of targets from such countries pay a price for their country's institutional framework that makes accounting information less value relevant. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cost Of Capital; Financial Reporting Quality; International Accounting Standards; Mergers; Transparency","","","","","Agrawal, Anup, The post-merger performance puzzle, Advances in Mergers and Acquisitions, 1, pp. 7-41, (2000); Agrawal, Anup, The Post‐Merger Performance of Acquiring Firms: A Re‐examination of an Anomaly, Journal of Finance, 47, 4, pp. 1605-1621, (1992); undefined, (2007); Ali, Ashiq, Country-specific factors related to financial reporting and the value relevance of accounting data, Journal of Accounting Research, 38, 1, pp. 1-21, (2000); André, Paul E., The long-run performance of mergers and acquisitions: Evidence from the Canadian stock market, Financial Management, 33, 4, pp. 27-43, (2004); Aw, M.

The contributors explore the important but little understood trade-offs that are involved, such as between policies which take effect quickly, those which minimize long-term fiscal and economic costs, and those which create favorable incentives for future stability.

Stock performance is measured as the average monthly stock return for the period 1996-2001. The sustainability performance is measured both by an evaluation of the environmental or social risks of the industry to which a company belongs and by an evaluation of the environmental or social activities of a company relative to the industrial average. We apply two-stage econometric approaches, which include recent insights from empirical finance. The most important result is that a higher environmental sector performance has a significantly positive influence on the stock performance. In contrast, a higher social sector performance has a negative influence. This effect is somewhat less significant. The variables of corporate environmental and/or social activities relative to the industry average have no significant effect. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Industrial Performance; Industrial Practice; Stock Market; Sustainability; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World","industrial performance; industrial practice; stock market; sustainability; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World","","","","Common Risk Factors in Explaining Canadian Equity Returns, (2001); Blacconiere, Walter G., Environmental Information and Market Reactions to Environmental Legislation, Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance, 12, 2, pp. 149-178, (1997); Nachhaltige Aktienanlagen Eine Analyse Der Rendite in Abhangigkeit Von Umwelt Und Sozialkriterien, (1999); Environmental and Financial Performance are They Related, (1997); Davis, James L., Characteristics, covariances, and average returns: 1929 to 1997, Journal of Finance, 55, 1, pp. 389-406, (2000); Fama, Eugene F., The Cross‐Section of Expected Stock Returns, Journal of Finance, 47, 2, pp. 427-465, (1992); Fama, Eugene F., Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds, Journal of Financial Economics, 33, 1, pp. 3-56, (1993); Fama, Eugene F., Multifactor explanations of asset pricing anomalies, Journal of Finance, 51, 1, pp. 55-84, (1996); Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, (2006); Hamilton, James T., Pollution as news: Media and stock market reactions to the toxics release inventory data, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 28, 1, pp. 98-113, (1995)","","Greenleaf Publishing","","","","","","09669671","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-10244244903"

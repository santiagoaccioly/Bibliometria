The primary aim of this paper is to examine whether the non-euro European economies are monetarily linked to the Euro Area. Using economic indicators from nine European countries, alongside the Eurozone, and employing SVECM models, this research assesses the degree of monetary integration. The empirical findings strongly indicate that the economies of Poland, Romania, Sweden and Norway have been positively bound and highly integrated with the Eurozone since the euro's launch. Moreover, the economies of Czechia and Hungary have demonstrated a steady and increasing level of monetary integration with the Eurozone over time. In contrast, the economies of Iceland, Switzerland, and the UK exhibit monetary divergence from the Eurozone. Based on these findings, the research proposes that Poland and Romania may need to explore the possibility of joining the Euro Area, while Norway and Sweden may (re)consider their stance on potential EU or EMU membership, respectively. The results underscore that the creation of the Eurozone and the circulation of the euro have played a significant role in facilitating and advancing monetary integration across Europe. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Currencies; European Economies; European Integration; Exchange Rates; Macroeconomic Indicators; Monetary Integration","","","","Since its foundation in 1999, the European Monetary Union (EMU) has encountered major reformations mainly due to the debt crisis of 2009 which eventually unveiled its structural weaknesses. In the aftermath of the 2009 sovereign debt crisis, five fundamental pillars were created in the EU in order to enhance its cohesion and solidity: a) the European Stability Mechanism, b) the European Banking Union, c) the reformed Stability and Growth Pact d) the upcoming Capital Markets Union and e) the EU Resilience and Recovery Fund. Although the above pillars tend to promote stability and the subsequent unity of the Euro Area, many have contrarily argued that these measures have not been sufficient to address the problems of the economic governance in the EU. Minford et al. (2022) concluded that the reformed Stability and Growth Pact should have been limited to monitoring solvency and that the creation of two Central Banks in the Eurozone could be the only sustainable solution for the efficient economic governance of the EU. Berriel et al. (2024) have also supported the idea that the reformed Stability and Growth Pact has not been competent to establish a well-organized governance in the European monetary union. Namely, they suggested a decentralized fiscal regime which, according to them, was the optimal solution for the small monetary unions because a centralized fiscal regime is mostly optimal for the larger ones. Similarly, the original Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon Treaty were also proved inefficient tools for EU economic governance. (Ioannou & Stracca, 2014). On the other hand, pillars such as the Resilience and Recovery Fund managed to prevent the emergence of a new debt crisis which the Covid-19 pandemic could have caused among the member-states. (De Grauwe & Ji, 2022). Likewise, Cole et al. (2023) supported the idea that the Next Generation EU initiative could be considered as a temporary solution towards an EU fiscal capacity. This initial step could gradually create the prototype version of the Full Fiscal Union which would lead towards a stronger and deeper degree of economic integration among the EMU member-states.On the other hand, other researchers focused their attention on the degree of financial integration in the Eurozone. Spiegel (2009) concluded that the introduction of the euro and the structural reformations within the union had increased its financial integration. He examined the impact of the euro on financial integration using econometric analyses to assess cross-border bank lending. He explored changes in financial flows following the euro's introduction and used panel data techniques to measure integration levels quantitatively. EMU stock markets were highly integrated between 1990 and 2014 due to the introduction of the euro (Lee & Kim, 2020). Lee and Kim (2020) utilized time-varying parameter models and panel regressions to study the integration of European stock markets between 1990 and 2014. These models allowed them to track changes in market convergence influenced by monetary drivers over time. Similar results were unveiled by other researchers who had focused on the aftermath of the European debt crisis (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Stoupos & Kiohos, 2022). Hoffmann et al. (2020) employed portfolio rebalancing models and econometric analyses on mutual fund holdings data. They used these methods to explore the dynamics of equity market integration and the effects of financial shocks on rebalancing behavior. However, both studies uncovered the heterogeneity of the financial integration among the EMU member-states. Alfaro and Blagov (2022) reinforced that the financial fragmentation in EMU had persisted since the sovereign-debt crisis and the diversity between the financially stressed and the non-stressed countries had been maintained. Alfaro and Blagov (2022) used econometric models, such as difference-in-differences (DiD), to evaluate financial fragmentation in the Eurozone. They analyzed divergence between stressed and non-stressed countries post-sovereign debt crisis. Additionally, Ozcan et al. (2010) discovered that the euro's impact on the financial integration had been primarily driven by the elimination of the currency risk and that trading goods had not played a key role in explaining the euro's positive effect on the financial integration. \u00D6zcan and co-authors (2010) employed panel data regression models to explore the drivers of the euro's impact on financial integration, particularly the elimination of currency risk and trade harmonization. Beckmann et al. (2024) have recently revealed that the capacity of the exchange rate which is needed to absorb the business cycle fluctuations in the Eurozone depends on the underlying shock and differs across the short and the medium run. Beckmann et al. (2024) analyzed the role of exchange rates in business cycle absorption using econometric models, including VAR models, to assess short- and medium-run effects of economic shocks in the Eurozone. Boubakri et al. (2012) proposed that the financial integration process of the Central Eastern European Countries' (CEEC) with the euro area was not yet complete. Boubakri and colleagues used panel data econometrics to assess the financial integration process of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) with the euro area. Their analysis focused on integration completeness. Also, Oanea (2015) suggested that the financial crisis had a significant impact on the financial markets' integration in the CEECs. Oanea examined the impact of the financial crisis on CEEC financial market integration using econometric models, particularly time-series regressions, to evaluate pre- and post-crisis integration levels. At the same time, Tang (2016) mentioned that European financial integration has affected the CEEC exports to the EU countries during 1994\u20132013. Tang analyzed European financial integration and its effect on CEEC exports using panel data econometrics. The study linked financial integration to export performance through quantitative techniques. Fornaro (2022) demonstrated that, creating a monetary union by eliminating this source of currency risk, increases the financial integration among the member countries, but this process does not necessarily lead to higher welfare. Fornaro employed theoretical models based on general equilibrium frameworks to demonstrate how eliminating currency risk through monetary union enhances financial integration without necessarily increasing welfare. Barros et al. (2011) tested the fractional integration models to describe the long-run dependency between the nominal exchange rates within the CEECs and the euro. They proved that the exchange rates in the CEECs had been highly persistent, especially those who had been based on the US dollar. Barros and co-authors applied fractional integration models to describe the long-term dependency between CEEC nominal exchange rates and the euro, emphasizing the persistence of exchange rate dynamics. Recently, Hannotin (2023) supported the idea that cross-border finance and banking in the CEECs is significantly driven by geographical proximity and common historical links, particularly with EU Member States. Hannotin used econometric analyses, including cross-sectional regression models, to study the determinants of cross-border finance in CEECs, emphasizing the role of geography and historical links with EU states.Schiff and Winters (1998) define the dynamic effects of economic integration schemes as any factor that influences a country's economic growth rate in the medium term. Henrekson et al. (1997) investigated the impact of European integration on economic growth, finding that EC/EFTA membership could boost growth rates by about 0.6\u20130.8 percentage points. Schiff and Winters used panel data regression models to assess the impact of European Community (EC) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) membership on economic growth. Their findings indicated that membership boosted growth rates by 0.6\u20130.8 percentage points. Similarly, Badinger (2005) argued that European integration has significantly contributed to the post-war economic growth of current EU member states, estimating that the EU's GDP per capita would be about one-fifth lower today had integration not occurred since 1950. Badinger conducted a counterfactual analysis using time-series econometric models to estimate the impact of European integration on GDP per capita. He concluded that the EU's GDP per capita would be about 20 % lower without integration since 1950. In a similar vein, Kutan and Yigit (2007) found that EU integration positively affects steady-state income levels, productivity growth rates, and convergence rates among member countries. Mixed productivity outcomes likely reflect the transition between steady states following accession. Their findings reveal not only productivity growth exceeding the EU benchmark post-accession but also accelerated growth pace driven by capital accumulation, supported by EU institutions, such as the EU Cohesion Fund. Kutan and Yigit applied dynamic panel data models using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator to study the effects of EU integration on productivity growth, income levels, and convergence among member states. Kim et al. (2005) demonstrated that the introduction of the euro\u2014and thereby deeper European monetary integration\u2014has led to increased stock market co-movements, primarily driven by macroeconomic convergence, rather than solely by the elimination of foreign exchange rate risk through currency unification. Kim and colleagues employed vector autoregression (VAR) models to analyze the co-movements of European stock markets after the introduction of the euro. They found that macroeconomic convergence drove increased stock market integration. Furthermore, Schmitz and Von Hagen (2011) argue that the economic and monetary union has strengthened capital flow within the euro area, particularly from wealthier to poorer countries, thus promoting economic convergence. Despite current account imbalances, these capital flows are viewed as a positive indicator of the euro area's functionality rather than a sign of macroeconomic instability. Schmitz and von Hagen used panel regression analysis to examine capital flows within the euro area. They argued that the EMU strengthened capital movements from wealthier to poorer countries, facilitating economic convergence. Nicita (2013) argues that trade policy is often employed to mitigate the effects of an overvalued currency, particularly by antidumping measures. Nicita used econometric analysis to explore the relationship between overvalued currencies and trade policy, focusing on how antidumping measures can mitigate the effects of currency misalignment on trade. Campos et al. (2014) present new estimates of the economic benefits from European economic and political integration. They analyzed how GDP per capita and labor productivity would have evolved for countries that joined the EU in the 1973, 1980s, 1995 and 2004 enlargements, had they not joined. Their findings show substantial positive effects from EU membership, with variations across countries and time (the only exception being Greece). Without deep economic and political integration, per capita income would have been, on average, approximately 12 percent lower. Campos and co-authors employed the Synthetic Control Method to estimate how GDP per capita and labor productivity would have evolved for EU member states without integration. Their results highlighted significant positive effects of the EU. Recently, McAdam et al. (2023) assessed alternative scenarios proposed to address trade imbalances within the euro area using a Structural Bayesian VAR. Their results indicate that a depreciation of the South Eurozone real exchange rate and/or a reduction of its unit labor cost could improve the South Eurozone trade balance by boosting exports. MacAdam et al. (2023) used a Structural Bayesian Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to evaluate trade imbalances in the euro area. They demonstrated that exchange rate depreciation and reduced unit labor costs could boost exports and improve trade balances.The research also explores the impact of trade imbalances on nominal exchange rates of non-euro European economies. The findings reveal a clear positive relationship between trade imbalances and the currencies of Hungary, Norway and Poland. This evidence is aligns with the J-curve economy theory (post-J-curve phase) where trade balance improvements strengthen currencies (Geldner, 2024). On the other hand, the results for other currencies are varied, suggesting diverse interactions through time. When a country's trade balance improves (larger trade surplus or lower deficit), it does not always lead to currency overvaluation. There are plenty of factors that could influence this counterintuitive outcome. Central banks can intervene (e.g. foreign currency purchases) in order to restrict currency appreciation and preserve the export competitiveness of a country. The nature of exports also plays an important role, especially if they are commodity-based and exposed to price volatility. For instance, Norway's economy is highly dependent on oil and gas exports. When global energy prices rise, Norway's trade balance improves, leading to stronger demand for Norwegian krone and an appreciation of its exchange rate (Saeed, 2020). Moreover, in cases of Poland and Hungary, capital flows such as foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investments, EU funding, and remittances, may significantly contribute to this positive relationship between trade imbalances and currency appreciation (Fisera & Horvath, 2022; Rajkovic et al., 2020).Also, the impulse responses coming from real inflation rate differentials express a positive impact on the currencies under study. Specifically, a positive impulse response from inflation differentials on the currency suggests that a positive inflation shock (i.e., higher domestic inflation relative to foreign inflation) leads to home currency appreciation. This effect can arise when the central bank responds to inflationary pressures by raising interest rates, which attracts foreign capital inflows and strengthens the domestic currency. The persistence of this effect depends on the central bank's ability to effectively control inflation and restore price stability. If inflation remains unchecked, the long-run impact may shift towards depreciation, aligning with purchasing power parity (PPP) dynamics. The results also indicate that impulse responses to trade imbalances have a positive impact on most of the currencies under study, except for the British pound, the Romanian leu, and the Swiss franc. A positive impulse response from trade imbalances in the home currency proposes that trade shocks could lead to an overvaluation of the home currency in the midterm. However, it is observed a deviation from this pattern for the British pound (GBP), Romanian leu (RON), and Swiss franc (CHF). The GBP is primarily influenced by capital flows, financial speculation, and monetary policy expectations. Hence, the sterling is less responsive to trade imbalances compared to other currencies. Additionally, Romania's economy is highly dependent on EU trade and expresses continuous current account deficits, which are largely financed by Foreign Direct Investments and EU structural funds. Similarly, the Swiss franc is as a global safe-haven currency for investors, and it is highly affected by global risk sentiment and monetary policy interventions than by trade imbalances. Swiss franc exchange rate movements are primarily influenced by investor behavior and central bank decisions, instead of any shifts in the trade balance.","Arce-Alfaro, Gabriel, Financial integration or financial fragmentation?

To examine the validity of this growing assertion, this study investigated the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from January 2000 to end of December 2023, focusing on how investor sentiment affects market volatility, with consideration of differing effects based on firm size. Utilizing a GARCH-MIDAS framework which allows for the decomposition of volatility into short-run and long-run components, the research examined whether investor sentiment significantly influences stock market volatility in South Africa. The analysis revealed that small- and mid-cap indices are particularly sensitive to shifts in investor sentiment in the short run. In contrast, the long-run volatility of mid-cap stocks is significantly influenced by macroeconomic factors, particularly inflation and exchange rate fluctuations. The findings also demonstrate that firm size has a significant impact on volatility dynamics, highlighting the diverse ways that small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks react to economic and behavioural factors. These results show that the JSE’s volatility patterns are shaped by the size-dependent roles of macroeconomic data and investor sentiment, and contributes to literature by providing novel evidence from a major emerging market, highlighting the importance of firm size in understanding the temporal pattern of volatility and its determinants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Garch-midas; Investor Sentiment; Size-based Indices; South Africa; Volatility","","","","Open access funding provided by University of KwaZulu-Natal.","Abdelmalek, Wafa, Investor sentiment, realized volatility and stock returns, Review of Behavioral Finance, 14, 5, pp. 668-700, (2022); Andleeb, Rameeza, Impact of Investor Sentiment on Contemporaneous and Future Equity Returns in Emerging Markets, SAGE Open, 13, 3, (2023); Asgharian, Hossein, The importance of the macroeconomic variables in forecasting stock return variance: A GARCH-MIDAS approach, Journal of Forecasting, 32, 7, pp. 600-612, (2013); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment in the stock market, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, 2, pp. 129-151, (2007); Banz, Rolf W., The relationship between return and market value of common stocks, Journal of Financial Economics, 9, 1, pp. 3-18, (1981); Barroso, Pedro, Beyond the Carry Trade: Optimal Currency Portfolios, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 50, 5, pp. 1037-1056, (2015); Beckmann, Joscha, Expectations, sentiments and capital flows to emerging market economies, Emerging Markets Review, 62, (2024); South African Equity Market Overview, (2024); Journal of Business, (1986); Chowdhury, Emon Kalyan, Catastrophic impact of Covid-19 on the global stock markets and economic activities, Business and Society Review, 127, 2, pp. 437-460, (2022)","","Palgrave Macmillan","","","","","","17434637; 14603799","9781608760114","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012264051"

Strong institutions may determine how well macroeconomic policies perform under both stable and turbulent circumstances. This study examines how institutional quality (IQ) moderates the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on economic growth in Thailand from Q1:2003 to Q4:2023. Using a combination of BART and BASAD models, we find that voice and accountability and control of corruption are key institutional factors. Among macroeconomic indicators, exports, household debt, gold prices, and electricity generation emerge as the most important drivers of growth during the study period. The findings showed that IQ stabilizes and enhances the impact of policy interest rates and export growth while mitigating negative shocks from household debt and energy infrastructure challenges. Monetary policy effectiveness varies and depends on governmental institutions. Fiscal policy remains mostly neutral but shifts with institutional conditions. These results highlight that strong institutions improve the efficacy of macroeconomic policies and support sustainable growth.

It provides novel insights into the literature of sentiment-related stock markets, ESG's impact on firm market value, and climate-related financial analysis. Using an advanced methodology, including the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) connectedness method and the quantile coherency technique, we uncover key findings on how ESG sentiment influences market behavior in the face of climate transition risks. Our main results indicate that European stock markets are highly vulnerable to climate transition risks, with sentiment acting as a key transmission channel. While positive ESG sentiment improves market valuation during stable periods, its effect weakens in times of market distress. Conversely, negative ESG sentiment strongly amplifies climate transition risk during both stable and unstable periods, dampening market enthusiasm and exacerbating market declines during instability. These effects persist through robustness tests, including an analysis of market volatility and a comparative study with the US context, where ESG uncertainty plays a key destabilizing role. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Transition Risks; Esg Sentiment; European Stock Markets; Financial Instability; Quantile Coherency; Tvp-var; Cost Benefit Analysis; Marketplaces; Auto-regressive; Climate Transition; Climate Transition Risk; Esg Sentiment; European Stock Market; Financial Instability; Parameter Vectors; Quantile Coherency; Time Varying Parameter; Time-varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive; Financial Markets; Climate Conditions; Market Conditions; Risk Assessment; Stock Market; Vector Autoregression; Europe","Cost benefit analysis; Marketplaces; Auto-regressive; Climate transition; Climate transition risk; ESG sentiment; European stock market; Financial instability; Parameter vectors; Quantile coherency; Time varying parameter; Time-varying parameter vector autoregressive; Financial markets; climate conditions; market conditions; risk assessment; stock market; vector autoregression; Europe","","","","Aksom, Herman, How institutional theories explain and fail to explain organizations, Journal of Organizational Change Management, 33, 7, pp. 1223-1252, (2020); Aloui, Donia, Exploring environmental degradation spillovers in Sub-Saharan Africa: the energy–financial instability nexus, Economic Change and Restructuring, 56, 3, pp. 1699-1724, (2023); Antonakakis, Nikolaos, The impact of Euro through time: Exchange rate dynamics under different regimes, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 1, pp. 1375-1408, (2021); British Food Journal, (2023); Stylized Facts from Mean and Volatility Dynamics April 2 2023, (2023); Ardia, David, Climate Change Concerns and the Performance of Green vs. Brown Stocks, Management Science, 69, 12, pp. 7607-7632, (2023); Firms and Collective Reputation A Study of the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal, (2019); Bagh, Tanveer, Climate change sentiment, ESG practices and firm value: international insights, China Finance Review International, (2024); Bagh, Tanveer, From risk to resilience: Climate change risk, ESG investments engagement and Firm's value, Heliyon, 10, 5, (2024); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment in the stock market, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, 2, pp. 129-151, (2007)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01409883","","EECOD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006880993"

This is because investment in renewable energy is crucial in light of climate change. Although numerous studies have investigated the factors driving renewable energy, little is known about how market stress affects renewable energy. This study explores the critical question that has emerged in the financial literature over the past few decades, namely, the role of financial stress in promoting renewable energy investment. To this end, we employ bivariate and multivariate quantile-on-quantile and wavelet coherence to investigate the effect of financial market stress on renewable energy investment covering the period from 1998 to 2021. Our results show that financial stress adversely affects renewable energy investment during extreme economic downturn. This implies that when market is under stress funding for renewable energy become much harder to secure due to systemic risk. These findings highlight the importance of financial stability for accelerating renewable energy adoption. To sustain renewable growth, BRICS economies need resilient financial policies, such as green financing mechanisms, credit support for renewable firms, and investment-friendly regulations. Ensuring financial stability can help attract long-term capital, making renewable energy a more viable and scalable solution for the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brics; Financial Stress; Multivariate Quantile-on-quantile; Renewable Energy; Wavelet Coherence; Commerce; Electronic Trading; Energy Economics; Energy Policy; Investments; Renewable Energy; Renewable Fuels; Brics; Financial Risks; Financial Stability; Financial Stress; Multivariate Quantile-on-quantile; Policy Makers; Renewable Energies; Renewable Energy Investments; Renewables; Wavelet Coherences; Financial Markets","Commerce; Electronic trading; Energy economics; Energy policy; Investments; Renewable energy; Renewable fuels; BRICS; Financial risks; Financial stability; Financial stress; Multivariate quantile-on-quantile; Policy makers; Renewable energies; Renewable energy investments; Renewables; Wavelet coherences; Financial markets","","","","Shimbar, Ali, Political risk and valuation of renewable energy investments in developing countries, Renewable Energy, 145, pp. 1325-1333, (2020); Ozili, Peterson K., Global energy crisis: Impact on the global economy, pp. 439-454, (2023); Yang, Xiaolei, How does China's green institutional environment affect renewable energy investments?

Unlike conventional causality analysis methods, such as Granger causality or transfer entropy, CCM accounts for non-separable, weakly connected dynamic systems, and TDCCM explicitly incorporates time lags during cross-mapping, enabling the detection of complex causal relationships in systems with shared nonlinear behavior. This makes it particularly suitable for financial time series that often exhibit chaotic and nonlinear dynamics, particularly during periods of market instability. We integrate TDCCM with simplex projection and sequential locally weighted global linear map (S-map) algorithms, applying a sliding window approach to identify short time intervals characterized by high levels of nonlinearity and chaoticity. Using this approach, we uncovered a strong causal relationship between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis reveals a bidirectional causal relationship between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index, highlighting their interconnectedness during periods of heightened economic uncertainty. Furthermore, we find a unidirectional causal influence of Bitcoin on gold, reflecting Bitcoin's evolving role as a macroeconomic indicator and its growing relevance as an alternative store of value. These findings provide insight into the dynamics between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets, particularly during periods of global economic disruption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; Causality; Time Series; Time-delay Convergent Cross-mapping; Bitcoin; Financial Markets; Analysis Method; Causal Relationships; Causality; Causality Analysis; Dynamic Time; Granger Causality; Time-delay Convergent Cross-mapping; Time-delays; Times Series; Transfer Entropy; Time Series","Bitcoin; Financial markets; Analysis method; Causal relationships; Causality; Causality analysis; Dynamic time; Granger Causality; Time-delay convergent cross-mapping; Time-delays; Times series; Transfer entropy; Time series","","","Funding text 1: The first author is partially funded by the National Institute of Informatics and Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan .; Funding text 2: The first author is partially funded by the National Institute of Informatics and The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan.","Abarbanel, Henry D.I., Local false nearest neighbors and dynamical dimensions from observed chaotic data, Physical Review E, 47, 5, pp. 3057-3068, (1993); Antoniou, Antonios, Index futures and positive feedback trading: Evidence from major stock exchanges, Journal of Empirical Finance, 12, 2, pp. 219-238, (2005); Ausloos, M.

Accordingly, this study uses monthly data to construct a new market-wide investor sentiment index and test its effects on the JSE aggregated and disaggregated index returns in alternating market conditions for the period March 2007 to January 2024. The findings of the Markov regime-switching model reveal that when the JSE is in a bull market condition, the JSE oil and gas sector returns and the JSE telecommunication sector returns are affected positively by investor sentiment. Similarly, in a bearish state, the JSE health sector returns and JSE telecommunication sector returns are negatively affected by investor sentiment. Collectively, the findings suggest that the effects of investor sentiment on JSE index returns are regime-specific and time-varying, such that they are dependent on the market conditions (bull or bear) and the type of JSE index (aggregated or disaggregated index).

To address this limitation, this study develops a novel hybrid approach for stock market volatility forecasting, which synergistically combines a deep learning model (CNN-BiLSTM-Attention) with the GARCH-MIDAS model. The GARCH-MIDAS model can fully exploit mixed-frequency information, including daily returns, monthly macroeconomic variables, and EPU. The deep learning model can effectively capture both spatial and temporal patterns of multivariate time-series data, thus effectively improving prediction accuracy and generalization ability in stock market volatility forecasting.

Financial contagion, the phenomenon of events spreading and affecting financial markets, has gathered significant attention from scholars and practitioners. Numerous studies have been conducted on this topic, necessitating a thorough examination of the diverse approaches and findings related to financial contagion. Design/methodology/approach: This study reviews financial contagion research in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, analyzing 66 articles. This review, based on selected keywords and defined criteria, has a total of 1,470 citations referencing these articles as of April 2023. Notably, the GARCH model and the Copula model emerged as prominent methodologies for investigating the financial contagion effect. Findings: The results reveal the interconnectedness of financial markets, where economic and financial instabilities in one country affect others. The insights obtained from articles retrieved from the WoS and Scopus databases are as follows: The analyzed studies span the time range of 1999–2023. The publication count was minimal in 1999–2000 (1 each) and peaked in 2021 (13 articles), indicating a rising trend in research on financial contagion in recent years, reflecting an increased focus on the topic. The majority of articles related to financial contagion and corruption have multiple authors. Research limitations/implications: This study’s limitation is that network indicators are only used as explanatory variables. Future research could use these indicators to illustrate the topological configurations of financial structures, elucidating the dynamic evolution of financial networks and advancing a thorough understanding of contagion mechanisms from a network perspective. Practical implications: Policymakers should consider the effects of financial contagion cross various financial markets, particularly in neighboring nations, when establishing policies address a financial crisis. Countries need to protect their economic frameworks, ensure the smooth operation of their economies and manage investment decisions within acceptable risks levels. Examining the impact of financial crises and pandemics on the financial system’s vulnerability to financial contagion is essential for policymakers and risk to develop effective strategies. Originality/value: By synthesizing current research findings, this paper provides insights into potential avenues for future studies on this critical topic, thereby enhancing the understanding of financial contagion. This paper enriches the existing literature by presenting a systematic overview of financial contagion research, concentrating on financial contagion during periods of financial crises and pandemics and emphasizing the increasing interest in this field in recent years. Furthermore, this paper adds to the literature on the financial contagion effects of COVID-19, offering a clearer understanding of the nature of this crisis and its distinctive characteristics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Copula Model; Financial Contagion; Financial Crisis; Financial Markets; G10; G15; G32; Garch Model; Jel Classification G01; Systematic Literature Review","","","","The authors express their appreciation and thanks to the Emerald Publishing Group, and they extend special thanks to the Journal of Money Laundering Control, which will receive the paper and help to publish it, and great thanks and appreciation to the journal's reviewers and its editorial board for their valuable comments and suggestions, which will help to improve the quality of the paper and bring it to the level required for publication.

Using the Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) model, the research examines both short-term and long-term relationships between NPLs and key macroeconomic indicators, such as inflation, GDP growth, public debt, and unemployment rates. Additionally, macroeconomic stress tests are incorporated to assess the impact of economic shocks on default risk and analyze the sensitivity of NPL rates to changes in these macroeconomic determinants. The empirical results indicate that inflation and unemployment significantly affect NPLs across European banking institutions. Furthermore, the analysis of stress scenarios reveals that European banks, particularly those in Italy and Germany, have been notably impacted by both the financial crisis and the recent pandemic crisis of 2020. Policymakers and governments must take necessary precautions to mitigate the consequences of adverse scenarios and support banks in managing credit risk to maintain financial market stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Risk; Cs-ardl Model; European Banking Systems; Macroeconomic Credit Stress Test; Macroeconomic Factors; Npls","","","","","Testing Macroprudential Stress Tests the Risk of Regulatory Risk Weights, (2025); Açıkgöz, Şenay, The endogeneity of the natural rate of growth: An application to Turkey, Panoeconomicus, 57, 4, pp. 447-469, (2010); Aikman, David P., Reputation, risk-taking, and macroprudential policy, Journal of Banking and Finance, 50, pp. 428-439, (2015); Macro Prudential Stress Test Models A Survey, (2023); Eighteenth Issue September 2009 of the International Journal of Central Banking, (2018); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Corporate Financial Distress and Bankruptcy, (1993); Altunbaş, Yener, Macroprudential policy and bank risk, Journal of International Money and Finance, 81, pp. 203-220, (2018); Anastasiou, Dimitris, Nonperforming loans in the euro area: Are core–periphery banking markets fragmented?, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 24, 1, pp. 97-112, (2019); Apergis, Emmanuel, A new macro stress testing approach for financial realignment in the Eurozone, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 61, pp. 52-80, (2019)","","Sciendo","","","","","","18009581; 23369205","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009800313"

For instance, banks can incorporate volatility forecasts into stress testing frameworks to ensure they are holding sufficient capital during extreme market conditions. However, volatility forecasting is challenging because volatility can only be estimated, and different factors influence volatility, ranging from macroeconomic indicators to investor sentiments. While recent works show promising advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence for volatility forecasting, a comprehensive assessment of current statistical and learning-based methods is lacking. Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the historical evolution of volatility forecasting with a comparative benchmark of key landmark models, such as implied volatility, GARCH, LSTM, and Transformer.

Particularly, the effects of green housing ratings on prices and purchasing decisions have not been thoroughly researched. A dataset comprising 14,335 items (4101 groups) was compiled of second-hand green housing transactions from spatial and temporal dimensions across various Chinese cities. To manage data clustering and enhance model robustness, the Bootstrap algorithm sampling and geographically weighted Lasso regression were utilized. The findings reveal several insights: (1) The spatial dimension notably impacts second-hand green housing prices, with regional differences evident in the effects of identical variables. This suggests that policy should be locally adapted, requiring nuanced and differentiated regulatory strategies. (2) Macroeconomic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product, Per Capita Disposable Income, and residential commercial property sales, positively influence housing prices. Monitoring these economic indicators for timely policy adjustments is advised. (3) At the microeconomic level, the architectural features of second-hand green housing negatively affect prices in the northeast and southwest regions. Conversely, neighborhood characteristics negatively impact prices in the southeast coastal region but positively influence them in central and northeastern regions. These results suggest that regular assessments of neighborhood characteristics and stringent regulation of architectural features by the government are necessary to maintain housing stock quality.

As a result, making significant gains in stock market investments is a crucial task. However, expert and intelligent modeling techniques can help in achieving positive stock market returns. In this study, we use the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method to generate multiple future values of the time series of closing prices of a particular stock of BSE using a combination of wavelet denoising and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The multiple future realizations of stock prices produced by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation can help minimize risk and uncertainty in stock market investments. Firstly, we use wavelet analysis to detect significant noise levels in the time series at each scale in discrete wavelet decomposition, which is then eliminated by an appropriate wavelet denoising method. Next, the time series of denoised stock prices is fitted with a suitable ARIMA model, and the future values are obtained using this model. The future values of the denoised time series are simulated using MC simulation. The results of the study show that simulated forecasts obtained by MC simulation using the integrated wavelet-denoising-ARIMA model become more accurate with increasing simulation count than by applying a single ARIMA model to noisy stock price series. It has also been observed that MC simulation reduces the standard error of estimates to one half when the number of simulations is quadrupled. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arima Model; Discrete Wavelet Transform; Forecasting; Monte Carlo Simulation; Wavelet Denoising; Costs; Discrete Wavelet Transforms; Financial Markets; Investments; Monte Carlo Methods; Prediction Models; Risk Assessment; Time Series; Wavelet Decomposition; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model; Discrete-wavelet-transform; Forecasting Models; Monte Carlo's Simulation; Moving Average Model; Stock Market Prices; Stock Price; Times Series; Wavelet Denoising; Autoregressive Moving Average Model","Costs; Discrete wavelet transforms; Financial markets; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Prediction models; Risk assessment; Time series; Wavelet decomposition; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average model; Discrete-wavelet-transform; Forecasting models; Monte Carlo's simulation; Moving average model; Stock market prices; Stock price; Times series; Wavelet denoising; Autoregressive moving average model","","","The authors are grateful to the VC, I K Gujral Punjab Technical University (Government of Punjab) and VC, Guru Nanak Dev University (Government of Punjab), for providing a research facility.

This paper explores how financial, non-financial, and macroeconomic factors influence delisting likelihood among companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), addressing a limitation in the current body of knowledge that often overlooks the combination of these factors, especially within the context of developing economies. Using a sample of 302 companies delisted between 2010 and 2023 and 302 as a control group, we analyzed 72 variables through a multivariate panel probit regression model. Our findings reveal that delisting decisions are driven by a complex interplay of financial health, governance practices, and macroeconomic conditions. Financial health, including liquidity and market valuation, is crucial in mitigating delisting risk. Non-financial factors, such as corporate governance and shareholder composition, further reduce the likelihood of delisting.

The results of the in-sample test show that several macroeconomic variables, such as the three-month Treasury bill rate, default yield spread, term spread, and economic policy uncertainty index during the full sample period, as well as the term spread, VIX, three-month Treasury bill rate, dividend-price ratio, and economic policy uncertainty index during the monetary policy intervention period, show the ability to forecast returns for a minimum of two cryptocurrencies. We also find enhancements to these predictive capabilities during the monetary policy intervention period. The out-of-sample test validates the effectiveness of our in-sample findings and unveils additional macroeconomic variables that also have predictive ability. Our results show superior forecasting ability when utilizing these combination methods. Our findings also suggest that incorporating global factors, such as the MSCI All Country World Index, can improve forecasting ability. During the cryptocurrency bubble period, we find that the 10-year US government bond yield, dividend yield ratio, capacity utilization rate, and US economic policy uncertainty index can forecast at least two cryptocurrency returns. Furthermore, we observe that in addition to US macroeconomic variables, certain trade-related variables from other countries, such as the annual growth rates of export values for the United States, United Kingdom, and China, as well as the annual growth rates of import values for Japan and Italy, can forecast returns for at least two cryptocurrencies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Aalborg, Halvor Aarhus, What can explain the price, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin?, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 255-265, (2019); Aboura, Sofiane, A note on the Bitcoin and Fed Funds rate, Empirical Economics, 63, 5, pp. 2577-2603, (2022); Adrian, Tobias, Stock returns and volatility: Pricing the short-run and long-run components of market risk, Journal of Finance, 63, 6, pp. 2997-3030, (2008); Afonso, António, Long-term government bond yields and economic forecasts: Evidence for the EU, Applied Economics Letters, 17, 15, pp. 1437-1441, (2010); Ahmed, Walid M.A., Robust drivers of Bitcoin price movements: An extreme bounds analysis, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 62, (2022); Aslanidis, Nektarios, An analysis of cryptocurrencies conditional cross correlations, Finance Research Letters, 31, pp. 130-137, (2019); Aysan, Ahmet Faruk, Effects of the geopolitical risks on Bitcoin returns and volatility, Research in International Business and Finance, 47, pp. 511-518, (2019); Baek, Chung, Bitcoins as an investment or speculative vehicle?

Interpreting the prediction models used for forecasting important macroeconomic indicators is highly valuable for understanding relations among different factors, increasing trust towards the prediction models, and making predictions more actionable. In this study, we develop a fundamental-based model for the Canadian–U.S. dollar exchange rate within an interpretative framework. We propose a comprehensive approach using machine learning to predict the exchange rate and employ interpretability methods to accurately analyze the relationships among macroeconomic variables. Moreover, we implement an ablation study based on the output of the interpretations to improve the predictive accuracy of the models. Our empirical results show that crude oil, as Canada’s main commodity export, is the leading factor that determines the exchange rate dynamics with time-varying effects. The changes in the sign and magnitude of the contributions of crude oil to the exchange rate are consistent with significant events in the commodity and energy markets and the evolution of the crude oil trend in Canada. Gold and the TSX stock index are found to be the second and third most important variables that influence the exchange rate. Accordingly, this analysis provides trustworthy and practical insights for policymakers and economists and accurate knowledge about the predictive model’s decisions, which are supported by theoretical considerations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodity Price; Exchange Rate Forecasting; Interpretability Method; Machine Learning; Macroeconomic Variable","","","","","Annals of Operations Research, (2021); Adadi, Amina, Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), IEEE Access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Adegboye, Adesola, Machine learning classification and regression models for predicting directional changes trend reversal in FX markets, Expert Systems with Applications, 173, (2021); Econometrics Journal, (2004); Amano, Robert A., Exchange rates and oil prices, Review of International Economics, 6, 4, pp. 683-694, (1998); Antwi, Samuel, The effect of macroeconomic variables on exchange rate: Evidence from Ghana, Cogent Economics and Finance, 8, 1, (2020); Atems, Bebonchu, Do exchange rates respond asymmetrically to shocks in the crude oil market?, Energy Economics, 49, pp. 227-238, (2015); Azzone, Michele, A machine learning model for lapse prediction in life insurance contracts, Expert Systems with Applications, 191, (2022); Nber International Seminar on Macroeconomics, (2010); Bartsch, Zachary, Economic policy uncertainty and dollar-pound exchange rate return volatility, Journal of International Money and Finance, 98, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","15729974; 09277099","069112549X; 9780691125497","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001585118"

By uncertainty shocks, this paper refers to uncertainty shocks emanating from economic policies or geopolitical risks. Using monthly data over the January 2009-May 2022 period, a non-linear panel ARDL-PMG model (Shin et al., 2014) is applied to estimate the relationship between inflation, industrial production, longterm interest rates, uncertainty (economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risks) and stock prices. In the long term, the results indicate a stable relationship between the selected variables and the different stock prices. However, the asymmetric results show that uncertainty has a negative impact on stock prices in both the short and long term. The results suggest important implications for political and economic decision-makers, especially after the succession of endogenous and exogenous financial crises in recent years. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cost Benefit Analysis; Financial Markets; Economic Policies; Geopolitical Risks; Longest Run; Non Linear; Nonlinear Panels; Oecd Countries; Panel Ardl; Policy Risks; Stock Price; Uncertainty; Commerce","Cost benefit analysis; Financial markets; Economic policies; Geopolitical risks; Longest run; Non linear; Nonlinear panels; OECD countries; Panel ARDL; Policy risks; Stock price; Uncertainty; Commerce","","","","Abugri, Benjamin A., Empirical relationship between macroeconomic volatility and stock returns: Evidence from Latin American markets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 17, 2, pp. 396-410, (2008); Macroeconomic Factors and Stock Market Movement Evidence from Ghana, (2008); Agyei, Samuel Kwaku, Spillovers and contagion between BRIC and G7 markets: New evidence from time-frequency analysis, PLOS ONE, 17, 7 July, (2022); American Journal of Economics, (2013); Anderson, Hamish D., The effect of macroeconomic announcements at a sectoral level in the US and European Union, Research in International Business and Finance, 44, pp. 256-272, (2018); Andrieş, Alin Marius, Analyzing time-frequency relationship between interest rate, stock price and exchange rate through continuous wavelet, Economic Modelling, 41, pp. 227-238, (2014); Antonakakis, Nikolaos, Oil shocks and stock markets: Dynamic connectedness under the prism of recent geopolitical and economic unrest, International Review of Financial Analysis, 50, pp. 1-26, (2017); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Economic policy uncertainty and stock markets: Long-run evidence from the US, Finance Research Letters, 18, pp. 136-141, (2016); Ashraf, Badar Nadeem, Economic policy uncertainty and banks’ loan pricing, Journal of Financial Stability, 44, (2019); Effects of Macroeconomic Variables on Stock Prices in Malaysia an Approach of Error Correction Model, (2009)","","IGI Global","","","","","","","9798369373590; 9798369373576","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004713042"

Investors are advised to weigh the costs and benefits associated with every decision in order to make rational investment decisions. However, behavioral finance research reveals that investors' choices often stem from a blend of economic, psychological and sociological factors, leading to irrationality. Moreover, environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors, aligned with behavioral finance hypotheses, also sway opinions and stock prices. Hence, this study aims to identify how individual equity investors prioritize key determinants of investment decisions in the Indian stock market. Design/methodology/approach: The current research gathered data from 391 individual equity investors through a structured questionnaire. Thereafter, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) was used to meet the purpose of the research. Findings: Information availability, representative heuristics belonging to psychological factors and macroeconomic indicators falling under economic factors were discovered to be the three most prioritized criteria, whereas environmental issues within the realm of ESG factors, recommendations of brokers or investment consultants of sociological factors, and social issues belonging to ESG factors were found to be the least prioritized criteria, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Only active and experienced individual equity investors were surveyed in this study. Furthermore, with a sample size of 391 participants, the study was confined to individual equity investors in one nation, India. Practical implications: This research has implications for individual investors, institutional investors, market regulators, corporations, financial advisors, portfolio managers, policymakers and society as a whole. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no real attempt has been made to comprehend how active and experienced individual investors prioritize critical determinants of investment decisions by taking economic, psychological, sociological and ESG factors collectively under consideration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Finance; Equity Investor; F-ahp; Investment Decisions; Socially Responsible Investment; Behavioral Research; Commerce; Costs; Financial Markets; Hierarchical Systems; Investments; Behavioural Finances; Corporate Governance; Determinants Of Investment; Economic Factors; Environmental Governances; Equity Investors; Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy; Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process; Investment Decisions; Socially Responsible Investments; Analytic Hierarchy Process","Behavioral research; Commerce; Costs; Financial markets; Hierarchical systems; Investments; Behavioural finances; Corporate governance; Determinants of investment; Economic factors; Environmental governances; Equity investors; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Investment decisions; Socially responsible investments; Analytic hierarchy process","","","","Agarwal, Sumit, The brokerage firm effect in herding: Evidence from Indonesia, Journal of Financial Research, 34, 3, pp. 461-479, (2011); International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, (2008); European Journal of Economic Studies, (2016); Akhtar, Fatima, Investor personality and investment performance: from the perspective of psychological traits, Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 12, 3, pp. 333-352, (2020); Akhtar, Fatima, The impact of social influence on the relationship between personality traits and perceived investment performance of individual investors: Evidence from Indian stock market, International Journal of Managerial Finance, 14, 1, pp. 130-148, (2018); Holistic Approach to the Factors Affecting Individual Investor S Decision Making in the Gcc Markets Evidence from Oman and Saudi Arabia, (2017); Al-Hiyari, Ahmad, How do Stock Market Participants Value ESG Performance?

Additionally, we construct an environmental attention index for Chinese investors using the Baidu Index and principal components analysis methodology, which we integrate into the MSM-MIDAS model, creating the MSM-MIDAS-EA model to enhance crude oil price volatility predictions. Our empirical results indicate that the MSM-MIDAS models, which account for the multifractality of the Chinese crude oil market, outperform GARCH-MIDAS models in predicting the short-, medium-, and long-term volatility of Chinese crude oil futures.

With effective differentiation between contemporaneous correlations and lagged spillovers, the empirical results show that, while the overall connectedness is mainly driven by contemporaneous components during tranquil periods, the lagged volatility spillovers play a more prominent role especially during extreme market turmoil. Moreover, both return and volatility transmission present significant time-varying characteristics and even-dependent patterns, with prominent spikes during periods of extreme events such as the 2007–2009 global financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which is further supported with formal statistical evidence utilizing the event-driven probabilistic analysis. Lastly, we further spot that the commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar prevailingly transmit to the connectedness network, while the agricultural commodity markets mainly serve as risk receivers, with potential net position reversal under various market conditions.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how economic uncertainty and political risk impact Türkiye’s financial stability, as reflected in its CDS market. This study investigates the importance of ex ante proxies in explaining changes in CDS spread by financial and economic indicators in Türkiye. Design/methodology/approach: This research explores the connections between critical financial and economic indicators and the credit risk of Türkiye between 2009 and 2022 by using advanced econometric techniques such as ARDL bound tests, fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), Johansen co-integration tests and VECM Granger causality analyses. Findings: ARDL bound test results reveal significant negative impacts of BIST and non-performing loans on CDS, and positive associations with inflation, VIX and geopolitical risk on CDSs. The short-term results show that BIST, INFL, NPL, USD, VIX and GPRT have negative coefficients. Johansen co-integration, FMOLS and DOLS results reinforce the ARDL findings. Moreover, BIST is a significant Granger cause of CDS. Originality/value: This study is significant, as it jointly considers economic and political risk factors, thereby integrating multiple econometric models to provide more robust, meaningful and comparable results. By examining these factors together, the analysis offers a more comprehensive understanding of risk dynamics, yielding insights relevant to Türkiye. Although the findings are specific to Türkiye, they have broader implications, enriching the understanding of emerging economies. Türkiye’s status as a key representative of emerging markets strengthens the study’s value, as the results can serve as a reference point for other countries with similar economic structures. The importance of this study is also underscored by its potential to inform risk management strategies, guide policy decisions and offer insights to investors and financial analysts. By elucidating the intricate relationships among a broad spectrum of macroeconomic variables, this research contributes to a more comprehensive risk assessment framework. It equips stakeholders with a more informed perspective on the factors influencing credit risk in Türkiye’s economic landscape. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodities; Credit Default Swaps; Economy; Financial Markets; Geopolitical Risk","","","","","Dumlupnar Universitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, (2021); Anemon Journal of Social Sciences of Mus Alparslan University, (2020); Akyüz, Gülay Çizgici, The relationship between credit default swap and macroeconomic indicators: An example from turkey, Contemporary Studies in Economic and Financial Analysis, 106, pp. 165-177, (2021); Lahore Journal of Business, (2010); Amiri, Arshia, Granger causality between total expenditure on health and GDP in OECD: Evidence from the Toda-Yamamoto approach, Economics Letters, 116, 3, pp. 541-544, (2012); Augustin, Patrick, Sovereign credit risk and exchange rates: Evidence from CDS quanto spreads, Journal of Financial Economics, 137, 1, pp. 129-151, (2020); Journal of Finance and Banking Review, (2020); Istanbul Business Research, (2021); Aytekin, Sinan, Do CDS Spreads and Inflation Move Together?

However, to enhance such protection, executives in the banking sector should recognize the factors that can affect the management of loan loss reserves. This study sought to investigate a novel set of macroeconomic and non-macroeconomic factors that can have an impact on the LLR ratios of banks in the United States (US). Data were retrieved from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database, considering the population of the banks in the US for the fiscal years 2015 to 2023. Dynamic panel regression methods, including ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effects models (FEMs), and random-effects models (REMs), were used to reach the research goal. The results demonstrate that both macroeconomic and non-macroeconomic factors significantly influence the behavior of LLRs in the United States. We clearly recognized industrial production as the macroeconomic indicator with the highest influence on LLRs, accurately representing the sector’s activity level through its calculation. The research findings demonstrate that industrial production is crucial in banks’ strategies regarding LLRs. Further, the S&P 500 has the most substantial impact on LLRs in a non-macroeconomic framework. Also, the results indicate that US banks are seeing a resurgence and are proactively allocating resources for their recovery. Overall, the findings of the study suggest that the financial institutions of the US ought to enhance their loan provisioning strategies in order to optimize resource allocation and improve the overall business performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit; Dynamic Panel Regression Analysis; Financial Sector; Loan Loss Reserves","","","","","Adhikari, Tamanna, Did raising doing business scores boost GDP?, Journal of Comparative Economics, 51, 3, pp. 1011-1030, (2023); International Symposium on Sustainable Development, (2009); Apergis, Nicholas, The role of loan loss provisions in income inequality: Evidence from a sample of banking institutions, Journal of Financial Stability, 73, (2024); Ayberk, İdil, House prices and bank loan portfolios in an emerging market: The role of bank ownership, Economic Modelling, 106, (2022); Comparison of the Indicators Describing the Loan Prtfolio Quality of the Banking Sector, (2009); Beck, Paul J., Did the SEC impact banks' loan loss reserve policies and their informativeness?, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 56, 2-3, pp. 42-65, (2012); Bergerès, Anne Sophie, Is there any dependence between consumer credit line utilization and default probability on a term loan?

Although there is growing literature on the economic impact of climate change, research on how drought affects the economy from a frequency domain perspective remains limited. This study empirically applies the Hilbert-Huang Transformation (HHT) and a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model to examine the intricate relationship between extreme weather events, specifically drought, and China’s economic growth through a comprehensive time-frequency analysis. Using the HHT, we uncover the underlying periodicities within China’s GDP growth rates, systematically clarifying these into short, medium, and long-term growth cycles. Subsequent quantification with the SVAR model reveals that drought affects economic growth differently across various frequency perspectives, allowing us to discern the macroeconomic impacts of droughts over different time horizons. Droughts precipitate immediate but transient declines in short-term economic growth, while causing volatile impacts on medium-term components and more enduring effects on long-term components. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drought; Economic Growth Cycles; Gdp Growth Rate; Hilbert-huang Transformation; Spei; Svar","","","","","Baharumshah, A.

It clarifies and introduces a conceptual framework with consumer confidence index and commercial real estate return. The research investigates whether fundamentals or consumer sentiment is more helpful in explaining commercial real estate returns. It proposes that consumer sentiment is exogenous in the conceptual framework. Consumer confidence index is decomposed into two components: fundamentals, as signaled by macroeconomic indicators, and the residual part, representing consumer sentiment. Using data in New Zealand markets, it is found that commercial real estate total return and capital return are more explained by consumer sentiment than by fundamentals. On the contrary, commercial real estate income return is more explained by fundamentals. Consumer sentiment imposes sustained effect on capital return and total return. Findings imply that valuers incorporate market sentiment into their valuation process. On top of that, investors rely on market sentiment during the transaction process. Industrial and Bulk Retail sectors enjoy positive impacts of COVID on capital return. Results imply potential diversification benefits across different commercial real estate sectors during market shocks. The study provides additional insight into consumer confidence and consumer sentiment and its intriguing relationship with commercial real estate return. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commercial Real Estate Return; Consumer Sentiment; Investor Sentiment","","","","","Abosedra, Salah S., Dynamics and asymmetries between consumer sentiment and consumption in pre- and during-COVID-19 time: Evidence from the US, Journal of Economic Asymmetries, 24, (2021); Business Economics, (2005); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns, Journal of Finance, 61, 4, pp. 1645-1680, (2006); Journal of Property Valuation and Investment, (1996); Journal of Finance, (1986); Bouteska, Ahmed, Does investor sentiment create value for asset pricing?

Specifically, structural breaks in the realized beta are detected by Iterated Cumulative Sum of Square (ICSS) algorithm and asymmetric risk effects are captured by decomposing the realized beta further into various components following Ang et al. (2006) and Bollerslev et al. (2021). We propose a set of Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model variants by incorporating these new predictors. To achieve model parsimony and to keep only the predictors with significant power, we employ Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method for variable selection. Our proposed LASSO[sbnd]HAR model with estimators of structural breaks and asymmetric risk effects is found to yield more accurate out-of-sample beta forecasts than a variety of alternative models in terms of both statistical and economic criteria. In particular, our model successfully achieves the long-memory feature of realized betas in a tractable and parsimonious way.

However, numerous influencing factors bring serious challenges to crude oil price forecasting, and existing research has room for further improvement in terms of an integrated research roadmap that combines impact factor analysis with predictive modelling. This study aims to examine the impact of financial market factors on the crude oil market and to propose a nonlinear combined forecasting framework based on common variables. Four types of daily exogenous financial market variables are introduced: commodity prices, exchange rates, stock market indices, and macroeconomic indicators for ten indicators. First, various variable selection methods generate different variable subsets, providing more diversity and reliability. Next, common variables in the subset of variables are selected as key features for subsequent models. Then, four models predict crude oil prices using common features as inputs and obtain the prediction results for each model. Finally, the nonlinear mechanism of the deep learning technology is introduced to combine above single prediction results. Experimental results reveal that commodity and foreign exchange factors in financial markets are critical determinants of crude oil market volatility over the long term, as observed in experiments conducted on the West Texas Intermediate and Brent oil price datasets. The proposed model demonstrates strong performance regarding average absolute percentage error, recorded at 2.9962% and 2.4314%, respectively, indicating high forecasting accuracy and robustness. This forecasting framework offers an effective methodology for predicting crude oil prices and enhances understanding the crude oil market. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crude Oil Price Forecasting; Multi-subset; Nonlinear Weighted Combination; Variable Selection; Prediction Models; Combination Strategies; Crude Oil Market; Crude Oil Price Forecasting; Crude Oil Prices; Energy Economics; Machine-learning; Multi-subset; Nonlinear Combination; Nonlinear Weighted Combination; Variables Selections; Crude Oil Price","Prediction models; Combination strategies; Crude oil market; Crude oil price forecasting; Crude oil prices; Energy economics; Machine-learning; Multi-subset; Nonlinear combination; Nonlinear weighted combination; Variables selections; Crude oil price","","","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2023YFB3308903), Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund (No. 22YJA910004), the Humanities and Social Science Found of Ministry of Education of China (No. 22YJCZH028) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant (No. SK2022040), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant (JUSRP124043).; Funding text 2: This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 12026239), Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education Planning Fund (No. 22YJA910004), the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (No. 22YJCZH028) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant (No. SK2022040), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant (JUSRP124043).","Abedinia, Oveis, A New Feature Selection Technique for Load and Price Forecast of Electrical Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 32, 1, pp. 62-74, (2017); Aguiar-Conraria, Luís, Understanding the large negative impact of oil shocks, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 39, 4, pp. 925-944, (2007); Akram, Qaisar Farooq, Commodity prices, interest rates and the dollar, Energy Economics, 31, 6, pp. 838-851, (2009); Bachmeier, Lance J., Why Don't Oil Shocks Cause Inflation?

We use inflation rates from 2000 to 2022 and employ a variety of linear and nonlinear tests (such as the Brock–Dechert–Scheinkman–LeBaron nonlinearity test, the Harvey nonlinearity test, the Dickey–Fuller Generalized Least Squares linear unit root test, the Ng–Perron linear unit root test, the Cuestas–Ordonez nonlinear unit root test, the Park–Shintani nonlinear unit root test, and the Hu–Chen nonlinear unit root test). The findings revealed that the data generating process of inflation in the WAMZ countries is nonlinear and that there is inflation convergence in those countries. This means that the countries share similar long-run inflation and, therefore, meet one key criterion for a group of countries to share a common currency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inflation; Inflation Convergence; Nonlinear Analysis; West African Monetary Zone","","","","","Abadir, Karim Maher, Testing joint hypotheses when one of the alternatives is one-sided, Journal of Econometrics, 140, 2, pp. 695-718, (2007); International Business and Management, (2010); Monetary Policy Preferences in the West African Monetary Zone Evidence from Dynamic General Equilibrium Models, (2012); An Mphil Thesis Presented at University of Ghana, (2013); Anoruo, Emmanuel C., Testing nonlinear inflation convergence for the central African economic and monetary community, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 4, 1, pp. 1-7, (2014); Role of Inflation Differentials in Regional Adjustment Evidence from the United States, (2002); Balogun, Emmanuel Dele, Can Inflation in WAMZ Converge without Monetary Policy Coordination?, pp. 23-42, (2016); Economic Growth, (1995); Broock, W.

This study proposes an enhanced Dynamic Neuroplastic Networksarchitecture that integrates adaptive attention mechanisms, continual learning strategies, and hybrid econometric models to address the challenges of financial decision-making under dynamic conditions. By employing Markov Switching models, Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) models, and Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) models, we capture regime shifts and asymmetries in financial time series. We further refine volatility estimation using Realized Volatility (RV) and Realized GARCH models while detecting abrupt structural breaks through the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) test. To enhance predictive capabilities, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed alongside adaptive DNN modules for classifying market conditions. Hyperparameter tuning and robust model validation, including statistical significance testing and confidence interval analysis, were systematically conducted to ensure the reliability of results. Critical real-world applications of the proposed framework are discussed, and model limitations are acknowledged to guide future research directions. Unlike traditional continual learning frameworks that suffer from catastrophic forgetting, our model leverages dynamic synaptic consolidation inspired by Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) principles while incorporating adaptive attention layers that prioritize salient market features in real-time. The findings underscore the critical role of integrating neuroplastic continual learning with econometric analysis for improving financial forecasting, risk management, and market stability strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catastrophic Forgetting; Continual Learning; Financial Decision Making; Neuroplastic Networks","","","","","How can High Frequency Data and Automatic Feature Selection Be Used to Improve Forecasts of Volatility and Value at Risk for Brent Crude Oil Futures, (2024); Aitken, Kyle, Neural population dynamics of computing with synaptic modulations, eLife, 12, (2023); Continual and Incremental Learning in Computer Aided Diagnosis Systems International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, (2023); Alexander, Carol O., A critical investigation of cryptocurrency data and analysis, Quantitative Finance, 20, 2, pp. 173-188, (2020); Alibrahim, Hussain, Hyperparameter Optimization: Comparing Genetic Algorithm against Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization, pp. 1551-1559, (2021); Allioui, Hanane, Exploring the Full Potentials of IoT for Better Financial Growth and Stability: A Comprehensive Survey, Sensors, 23, 19, (2023); Predicting Financial Market Trends Using Time Series Analysis and Natural Language Processing, (2023); Belete, Daniel Mesafint, Grid search in hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models for prediction of HIV/AIDS test results, International Journal of Computers and Applications, 44, 9, pp. 875-886, (2022); International Conference on Digital Age Technological Advances for Sustainable Development, (2024); Cano, Alberto, ROSE: robust online self-adjusting ensemble for continual learning on imbalanced drifting data streams, Machine Learning, 111, 7, pp. 2561-2599, (2022)","","Springer","","","","","","15729974; 09277099","069112549X; 9780691125497","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012605612"

The researchers have taken monthly data from Jul 2001 to March 2023 and employed a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) approach to investigate the asymmetric effects of the variables. The Bound test result for the cointegration relationship demonstrated a long-run relationship (or cointegration) between LPSX, LSSE, and macroeconomic variables. However, no long-run relationship or Cointegration of LBSE and macroeconomic determinants exists. The findings of Asymmetric ARDL (NARDL) exhibited that the overall goodness of fit of LPSX, LBSE, and LSSE as the Adjusted R2 is 99.51%, 99.3%, and 94.3%, respectively, which means the exchange rate, interest rate, money supply, and inflation variables determine the changes in LPSX, LBSE, and LSSE. The findings of CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests suggested that the overall model is stable for LPSX, LBSE, and LSSE. The findings of the asymmetric short and long coefficients of the NARDL model demonstrated a long and short-run relationship between LPSX and LSSE and macroeconomic indicators. However, in the case of LBSE, there is only a short-run relationship between LBSE and macroeconomic indicators. The findings provide essential implications for policymakers in Pakistan, India, and China to manage and sustainably develop the stock markets successfully. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric Effects; Cointegration; Macroeconomic Indicators; Nonlinear Ardl; Stock Markets","","","","","Abbasi, Kashif Raza, Asymmetric impact of renewable and non-renewable energy on the industrial sector in Pakistan: Fresh evidence from Bayesian and non-linear ARDL, Renewable Energy, 187, pp. 944-957, (2022); Ahmad, Manzoor, Does financial development asymmetrically affect CO2 emissions in China?

The investigation encompasses a 12-month duration of historical stock data, integrating two technical indicators, namely Exponential Moving Averages (EMA-5 and EMA-10), to augment predictive precision. Gradient Boosting, recognized for its proficiency in managing intricate and non-linear data patterns, was employed to forecast forthcoming stock prices. Critical performance indicators, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R2), played a role in evaluating model accuracy, attaining an R2 score of 0.99, thereby signifying an almost perfect correlation between actual and predicted prices. Beyond numerical assessments, visual examinations through scatter plots, residual plots, and prediction error distribution further elucidated the model's efficiency. The findings reveal that the amalgamation of Gradient Boosting with Technical Indicators such as EMA-5 and EMA-10, coupled with an emphasis on the adjusted closing price, proves exceptionally effective for stock price forecasting.

However, challenges remain in adequately depicting market events and generating suitable rewards to influence the trading decisions of an agent in a dynamic environment. This study proposed an improved stock market trading framework termed the RMS-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model for optimal portfolio management. The research attempts to give a more comprehensive view of the market and, as a result, enhance trading decisions by including consumer information and incorporating news sentiments into the model, in addition to data from typical earnings reports. More specifically, three kinds of DRL models are presented, combined with data from stock earnings reports, Max Drawdown rewards, and sentiment indicators (RMS), known as PPO_RMS, A2C_RMS, and DDPG_RMS, respectively. The findings of this research indicate that the integrated model, mainly the DDPG_RMS effectively outperforms the baseline ^DJI index in many risk-return analyses in ratios showing better risk management, and profitability. The proposed stock trading model generates a maximum cumulative return of 27% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.66, showing an appropriate trade-off between risk and return. This approach, which incorporates sentiment analysis and Max Drawdown rewards, significantly enhances the model's performance in adapting to changing market conditions. Therefore, the results emphasize the appropriateness of integrating sentiment indices with traditional financial data to enhance a trader's performance while also offering essential information to aid in the development of improved trading tactics in continuously changing financial markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advantage Actor-critic (a2c); Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ddpg); Deep Reinforcement Learning (drl); Max Drawdown Rewards; Portfolio Management; Proximal Policy Optimization (ppo); Stock Market Trading; Contrastive Learning; Decentralized Finance; Marketplaces; Reinforcement Learning; A2c (advantage Actor-critic); Actor Critic; Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Deterministics; Max Drawdown Reward; Policy Gradient; Policy Optimization; Portfolio Managements; Proximal Policy Optimization; Reinforcement Learnings; Stock Market Trading","Contrastive Learning; Decentralized finance; Marketplaces; Reinforcement learning; A2C (advantage actor-critic); Actor critic; Deep deterministic policy gradient; Deep reinforcement learning; Deterministics; Max drawdown reward; Policy gradient; Policy optimization; Portfolio managements; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Stock market trading","","","This work was supported by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the Convergence security core talent training business support program (IITP-2025-RS-2023-00266605) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation).","Ansari, Yasmeen, A Multifaceted Approach to Stock Market Trading Using Reinforcement Learning, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 90041-90060, (2024); World J Ada Eng Technol Sci, (2024); Bustos, Oscar, Stock market movement forecast: A Systematic review, Expert Systems with Applications, 156, (2020); Nti, Isaac Kofi, A systematic review of fundamental and technical analysis of stock market predictions, Artificial Intelligence Review, 53, 4, pp. 3007-3057, (2020); Dhingra, Barkha, Stock market volatility: a systematic review, Journal of Modelling in Management, 19, 3, pp. 925-952, (2024); Cohen, Gil, Technical Analysis in Investing, Review of Pacific Basin Financial Markets and Policies, 26, 2, (2023); Chen, Gongmeng, Trading performance, disposition effect, overconfidence, representativeness bias, and experience of emerging market investors, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 20, 4, pp. 425-451, (2007); Wu, Xing, Adaptive stock trading strategies with deep reinforcement learning methods, Information Sciences, 538, pp. 142-158, (2020); Ferreira, Fernando G.D.C., Artificial Intelligence Applied to Stock Market Trading: A Review, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 30898-30917, (2021); Poterba, James M., Mean reversion in stock prices.

The possible loss that investors may incur because of their investment activity is referred to as investment risk. Returns on investments may fall short of expectations due to a variety of circumstances. Fit of the model to the data; performance in representing volatility, prediction, stability, and analysis; and interpretation goals are all factors to consider. This study investigates the volatility of the Indonesian composite index (ICI) using the GARCH-MIDAS model, integrating daily ICI returns with monthly macroeconomic indicators: Indonesian bank interest rates (BIIR), consumer price index (CPI), effective federal fund rate (EFFR), and inflation rate (IR). We begin by graphically analysing the trends in ICI returns and macroeconomic variables to identify potential patterns and shifts. Descriptive statistics offer a detailed numerical summary, setting the stage for in-depth empirical analysis. The long-run component of stock market volatility is estimated using the GARCH-MIDAS model, with macroeconomic variables included to capture their impact on market fluctuations. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed to estimate the model parameters, ensuring a robust fit to the observed data. Our findings indicate that the EFFR has the most significant impact on ICI volatility, contrary to previous studies. Forecasting performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), confirming the superior predictive capability of the EFFR variable. The study assesses risk using value at risk (VaR) for the ICI, incorporating the EFFR to account for macroeconomic influences on market volatility. VaR values at 99% and 95% confidence levels provide insights into potential maximum losses, aiding in informed investment decision-making. This research enhances knowledge of the relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock market volatility, providing investors and policymakers with important information for risk management and investment strategy optimization in the Indonesian equity market. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Equity Market; Investment Risk; Optimize; Volatility","","","","","Value at Risk the New Benchmark for Managing Financial Risk, (2007); Daníelsson, Jón, Financial Risk Forecasting: The Theory and Practice of Forecasting Market Risk with Implementation in R and Matlab, pp. 1-274, (2015); Lukitosari, Valeriana, The Predicted Failure on A Two-Dimensional Warranty Using the Bayesian Approach, Journal of Reliability and Statistical Studies, 16, 1, pp. 171-196, (2023); Financial Risk Management, (2017); undefined; Analysis of Financial Time Series, (2002); Econometrica, (1991); Midas Touch Mixed Data Sampling Regression Models, (2004); Engle, Robert F., Stock market volatility and macroeconomic fundamentals, Review of Economics and Statistics, 95, 3, pp. 776-797, (2013); Girardin, Éric, Macro fundamentals as a source of stock market volatility in China: A GARCH-MIDAS approach, Economic Modelling, 34, pp. 59-68, (2013)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","25777408","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000893165"

This study explores the complex relationship between macroeconomic factors and the performance of Lithuanian commercial banks. By analyzing empirical data, we seek to understand how fluctuations in various economic indicators affect interest income, service and fee income and loan portfolio size in the Lithuanian banking sector. There is a lack of such research, as the efficiency of banks' operations and the sensitivity of loan portfolio quality to changes in macroeconomic indicators depend mostly on the structure and characteristics of the banking sector in each country. The results of the study show that the impact of macroeconomic fluctuations on the Lithuanian commercial banking sector is relatively limited. Understanding the impact of macroeconomic factors on commercial banks is crucial for policy makers, investors, and practitioners.

Investors’ decisions focus not only on maximizing returns but also on reducing risk. This study examines the extent to which macroeconomic factors affect stock performance by comparing the effectiveness of the Fama–French five-factor model (5FF) and Fama–French seven-factor model (7FF) in estimating returns. This study also verifies Fisher’s theory in the context of property and real estate stocks. The research data used are property and real estate stocks in the Indonesian capital market. The data are processed using the OLS estimation method, and Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) is used to choose the optimal model. The results show that property and real estate stocks in Indonesia with negative profitability at all quantiles can hedge inflation and interest rates. However, the interest rates are not the only factor affecting the market risk. The 7FF model is better at explaining the variability of stock portfolio returns.

We observe similar reserve asset backing for fiat reserve backed (FRB) stablecoins and MMFs, similar importance of sponsor support, and the same negative association between macroeconomic indicators and peg deviations. Both instruments serve as short-term facilities for investors to park funds and their primary market microstructure is similar. However, FRB stablecoins exhibit larger dispersions from the dollar peg, significantly higher volatility, and a lack of transparency in their market infrastructure. Larger FRB stablecoins show reduced volatility compared to their smaller counterparts, with peg deviation drivers more closely resembling those of MMFs.

Using a quantile vector autoregression model and data from 2007 to 2022, we find that the cross-market linkages are quantile dependent, with the strongest connections observed in the tails of the distribution. A shock to the oil market significantly impacts ethanol and corn returns under extreme bearish and bullish conditions. Positive shocks to the corn market reduce ethanol returns when the ethanol market is highly bullish, but this effect becomes positive in the left tail of the distribution. We also identify significant co-movement in higher statistical moments between these markets. Extreme excess kurtosis in the food-fuel nexus is more likely to occur with high financial market uncertainty, a bullish stock market, contracting industrial production, and a strong US dollar. In addition to these variables, credit spreads, futures market liquidity, futures term structure, and hedging pressure also influence kurtosis in individual markets within the nexus. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biofuels; Corn Market; Crude Oil Market; Price Distribution; Quantile Vector Autoregression; Time-varying Moments","","","","Funding text 1: Jian Li and Linjie Wang acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72173052; 72473048), and the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 22&ZD079).

Many studies have analyzed the long- and short-term relationship between insurance and financial variables, particularly economic growth, using classical and benchmark methods. Given its impact on financial indicators, it is critical for policymakers to predict the insurance penetration rate, which can, in turn, forecast trends in other financial variables. This paper uses decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost to predict the insurance penetration rates for 30 OECD countries, identifying the most effective method for each country. The mean squared error for predicting the total insurance penetration rate with the decision tree and XGBoost is 2.32, and 1.461, respectively, while the loss function decreases to 1.1 with random forest. Additionally, XGBoost outperforms the other models in predicting non-life insurance penetration rate with an RMSE of 0.92, while for life insurance penetration rate, the random forest model has the highest accuracy, with an RMSE of 1.8. Using the prediction, for countries where the insurance penetration rate is going to decrease, policymakers could implement strategies that foster growth in the insurance sector and, consequently, boost other financial variables, particularly economic growth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C33; C53; Decision Tree; G22; Insurance Penetration Rate; Machine Learning; Oecd Countries; Random Forest; Xgboost","","","","","Akbar, Nur Arifin, Improvement of decision tree classifier accuracy for healthcare insurance fraud prediction by using Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, pp. 110-114, (2020); Akbari, Amir, Drivers of economic and financial integration: A machine learning approach, Journal of Empirical Finance, 61, pp. 82-102, (2021); Hossain, Amman, GDP growth prediction of bangladesh using machine learning algorithm, pp. 812-817, (2021); Apergis, Nicholas, The role of insurance growth in economic growth: Fresh evidence from a panel of OECD countries, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 53, (2020); Araújo, Gustavo Silva, Machine learning methods for inflation forecasting in Brazil: New contenders versus classical models, Latin American Journal of Central Banking, 4, 2, (2023); Aslam, Faheem, Insurance fraud detection: Evidence from artificial intelligence and machine learning, Research in International Business and Finance, 62, (2022); Bagherzadeh, Faramarz, Ensemble Machine Learning approach for evaluating the material characterization of carbon nanotube-reinforced cementitious composites, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 17, (2022); Bentéjac, Candice, A comparative analysis of gradient boosting algorithms, Artificial Intelligence Review, 54, 3, pp. 1937-1967, (2021); Bottou, Léon, Large-scale machine learning with stochastic gradient descent, pp. 177-186, (2010); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","1864404X; 18644031","","","","English","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203090718"

Macroeconomic indicators such as the IMF's growth forecast, GDP growth rate and real inflation rate significantly influence risk avoidance, and nonperforming loans are the only bank performance factors that explain this behavior. The quantile regression analysis shows that Thai investors have the highest level of risk avoidance, followed by investors from China, Indonesia and India, in descending order. This study offers a novel contribution by examining how nonperforming loans and inflation uniquely influence investor risk avoidance in developing economies.

The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis results show that technical and some macroeconomic factors play a dominant role in price production. It also examines the potential of these models for strategic investment and hedging, underscoring their relevance in an increasingly digital economy. Originality/value: According to our knowledge, the absence of AI research frameworks for forecasting and modelling current aria-leading AI tokens is apparent. Due to a lack of study on understanding the relationship between the AI token market and other factors, forecasting is outstandingly demanding. This study provides a robust predictive framework to accurately identify the changing trends of AI tokens within a multivariate context and fill the gaps in existing research. We can investigate detailed predictive analytics with the help of modern AI algorithms and correct model interpretation to elaborate on the behaviour patterns of developing decentralised digital AI-based token prices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai-tokens; Digital Economy; Investment Strategy; Long And Short-term Memory; Macroeconomic Indicators; Predictive Analytics","","","","This work was funded in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos: 72171197 and 72342028) and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province of China (No: 2023NSFSC0364).","Joel Aikins Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Volatility persistence in cryptocurrency markets under structural breaks, International Review of Economics and Finance, 69, pp. 680-691, (2020); Joel Aikins Abakah, Emmanuel Joel Aikins, Quantile price convergence and spillover effects among Bitcoin, Fintech, and artificial intelligence stocks, International Review of Finance, 23, 1, pp. 187-205, (2023); Aharon, David Yechiam, NFTs and asset class spillovers: Lessons from the period around the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Research Letters, 47, (2022); Machine Learning the Cryptocurrency Market, (2018); undefined, (2019); Top 10 AI and ml Supply Chain Companies and Solutions, (2023); Forecasting Bitcoin price direction with random forests: How important are interest rates, inflation, and market volatility?, 9; Predicting stock market index using LSTM[Formula presented], 9; Branny, Jerome, Non-fungible Token Price Prediction with Multivariate LSTM Neural Networks, pp. 56-61, (2022); Chhajer, Parshv, The applications of artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and long–short term memory for stock market prediction, Decision Analytics Journal, 2, (2022)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","01443585","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189169592"

Consequently, the study aims to examine the effect of market-wide investor sentiment on government bond index returns of varying maturities under changing market conditions. This study constructs a new market-wide investor sentiment index for South Africa and uses the two-state Markov regime-switching model for the sample period 2007/03 to 2024/01. The findings illustrate that the effect investor sentiment has on government bond indices returns of varying maturities is regime-specific and time-varying. For instance, the 1–3-year government index return and the over-12-year government bond index were negatively affected by investor sentiment in a bull market condition and not in a bear market condition. Moreover, the bullish market condition prevailed among the returns of selected government bond indices of varying maturities. The findings suggest that the government bond market is adaptive, as proposed by AMH, and contains alternating efficiencies. The study contributes to the emerging market literature, which is limited. That being said, it uses market-wide investor sentiment as a tool to make pronunciations on asset selection, portfolio formulation, and portfolio diversification, which assists in limiting investor losses. Moreover, the findings of the study contribute to settling the debate surrounding the efficiency of bond markets and the effect between market-wide sentiment and bond index returns in South Africa. That being said, it is nonlinear, which is a better modelled using nonlinear models and alternates with market conditions, making the government bond market adaptive. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bond Indices; Bull And Bear Regimes; Investor Sentiment; Principal Component Analysis","","","","","Aristei, David, Sovereign bond yield spreads and market sentiment and expectations: Empirical evidence from Euro area countries, Journal of Economics and Business, 76, C, pp. 55-84, (2014); Ashraf, Badar Nadeem, Stock markets’ reaction to COVID-19: Cases or fatalities?, Research in International Business and Finance, 54, (2020); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns, Journal of Finance, 61, 4, pp. 1645-1680, (2006); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment in the stock market, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, 2, pp. 129-151, (2007); Baker, Malcolm P., Market liquidity as a sentiment indicator, Journal of Financial Markets, 7, 3, pp. 271-299, (2004); Beer, Francisca Marie, Measuring stock market investor sentiment, Journal of Applied Business Research, 29, 1, pp. 51-68, (2013); Beirne, John, LOCAL CURRENCY BOND MARKETS, FOREIGN INVESTOR PARTICIPATION AND CAPITAL FLOW VOLATILITY IN EMERGING ASIA, Singapore Economic Review, 69, 2, pp. 517-541, (2024); Economics Discussion Papers, (2013); Brown, Gregory W., Investor sentiment and the near-term stock market, Journal of Empirical Finance, 11, 1, pp. 1-27, (2004); Comparative Study on African Equity Marketsin 2011, (2012)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277099","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207295040"

Political developments, pandemics, conflicts between countries, trade chains and general economic and financial problems that have frequently occurred worldwide in recent years have significantly affected the Turkish economy as well as all other countries. Türkiye's economy is intricately linked with global financial markets, and understanding the dynamics between domestic macroeconomic variables and external financial indicators can provide insights into the country's economic resilience and vulnerabilities to external shocks. Design/methodology/approach: Two distinct models are used in the analysis, with the Borsa Istanbul 100 (BIST100) Index and the Real Sector Confidence (RSC) Index serving as the dependent variables. This study examines the long- and short-term relationships between the BIST100, RSC index, the EURO/TRY exchange rate, bank loans provided to the private sector, imports and exports, and nonperforming loans (NPLs) with the ARDL bound, Johansen cointegration and VECM causality tests. The study uses monthly data spanning from December 31, 2002, to July 29, 2022, offering a comprehensive perspective on the dynamics of the Turkish economy. Findings: The findings reveal significant long-run relationships between the BIST100 and the exchange rate, imports and exports. Short-run dynamics indicate the importance of changes in these variables, as well as NPLs and RSC, in affecting the BIST 100. The model captures the impact of economic indicators such as imports, NPLs and exports on RSC. In addition, it underscores a long-run equilibrium relationship, suggesting a responsive RSC to deviations. There is a strong positive relationship between BIST100 and the RSC. Causality tests reveal temporal relationships and causal links, with evidence of bidirectional causality for some variables, providing comprehensive insights into the short-term dynamics and adjustment mechanisms influencing RSC in the Turkish economic context. Practical implications: Amidst global economic uncertainties and fluctuations, particularly in emerging markets such as Türkiye, understanding the relationships between financial market indicators and macroeconomic variables may help policymakers formulate effective monetary and fiscal policies aimed at stabilizing the economy, promoting sustainable growth and mitigating financial risks. In addition, these insights have practical implications for investors, regulators and other financial market participants seeking to make informed decisions in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic global economy.

Unlike traditional investment avenues such as the stock market, the foreign exchange (Forex) market revolves around two primary types of orders that correspond with the market's direction: upward and downward. Consequently, forecasting the behaviour of the Forex behaviour market can be simplified into a binary classification problem to streamline its complexity. Despite the significant enhancements and improvements in performance seen in recent proposed predictive models for the forex market, driven by the advancement of deep learning in various domains, it remains imperative to approach these models with careful consideration of best practices and real-world applications. Currently, only a limited number of papers have been dedicated to this area. This article aims to bridge this gap by proposing a practical implementation of deep learning-based predictive models that perform well for real-world trading activities. These predictive mechanisms can help traders in minimising budget losses and anticipate future risks. Furthermore, the paper emphasises the importance of focussing on return profit as the evaluation metric, rather than accuracy. Extensive experimental studies conducted on realistic Yahoo Finance data sets validate the effectiveness of our implemented prediction mechanisms. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that employing the use of three-value labels yields superior accuracy performance compared to traditional two-value labels, as it helps reduce the number of orders placed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Forecasting Model; Financial Time Series; Forex Market; Return Profit; Stock-movement Forecasting; Article; Best Practice; Binary Classification; Budget; Deep Learning; Experimental Study; Financial Market; Forecasting; Human; Investment; Market; Prediction; Predictive Model; Profit; Stock Market; Time Series Analysis","article; best practice; binary classification; budget; deep learning; experimental study; financial market; forecasting; human; investment; market; prediction; predictive model; profit; stock market; time series analysis","","","","Journal of Accounting and Finance in Emerging Economies, (2023); Sahu, Santosh Kumar, An Overview of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning-Based Techniques in Quantitative Finance: Recent Progress and Challenges, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 3, (2023); Vuong, Pham Hoang, A bibliometric literature review of stock price forecasting: From statistical model to deep learning approach, Science Progress, 107, 1, (2024); Yilmaz, Firat Melih, Statistical Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Stock Return Forecasting, Computational Economics, 63, 1, pp. 221-244, (2024); Khattak, Bilal Hassan Ahmed, Profitability trend prediction in crypto financial markets using Fibonacci technical indicator and hybrid CNN model, Journal of Big Data, 11, 1, (2024); Olorunnimbe, Kenniy, Deep learning in the stock market—a systematic survey of practice, backtesting, and applications, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 3, pp. 2057-2109, (2023); Journal of Appliedmath, (2023); Sonkavde, Gaurang, Forecasting Stock Market Prices Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models: A Systematic Review, Performance Analysis and Discussion of Implications, International Journal of Financial Studies, 11, 3, (2023); Zhang, Ning, Event-Triggered Distributed Hybrid Control Scheme for the Integrated Energy System, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 18, 2, pp. 835-846, (2022); undefined, (2024)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","20477163; 00368504","","","39169858","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202000691"

We fill this gap by contributing and conducting a robust bibliometric review on the application of AI innovations for stock market prediction. More specifically, we conducted a bibliometric review by identifying 241 relevant papers related to stock forecasting using AI by taking a quantitative approach. A quantitative approach uses an examination of linked articles to look at the development of research topics and the structure of existing knowledge. We identified five significant themes based on exploratory factor and hierarchical cluster analyses. We posited that successful AI-based models could aid stock traders, brokers, and investors in better decision-making, a task that had previously been fraught with difficulties. Overall, this paper is aimed at benefiting stock traders, brokers, businesses, investors, government, financial institutions, depositories, and banks. This paper concludes with a future research agenda. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bibliometric Review; Innovation; Prediction; Stock Market; Cluster Analysis; Commerce; Decision Making; Electronic Trading; Financial Markets; Hierarchical Systems; Investments; Bibliometric; Bibliometric Review; Decisions Makings; Hierarchical Cluster Analysis; Innovation; Innovative Techniques; Quantitative Approach; Research Topics; Stock Forecasting; Stock Market Prediction; Forecasting","Cluster analysis; Commerce; Decision making; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Hierarchical systems; Investments; Bibliometric; Bibliometric review; Decisions makings; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Innovation; Innovative techniques; Quantitative approach; Research topics; Stock forecasting; Stock market prediction; Forecasting","","","Despite being a well-researched financial field, stock returns prediction still engages researchers and academics. Accurately predicted stock movements have the potential to create profit opportunities for many investment brokers and individual investors (Bisoi and Dash, 2014). For instance, according to R. Jesse McWaters (2018) the assets under the hedge fund manager's AHL dimension fund, based in the UK, have quadrupled since 2014. Although there are several methods suited to forecast stock prices, it is not a simple feat owing to the time series' random behaviours (Kumar and Shrivastav, 2022). The extant literature has made use of numerous indicators\u2014technical, fundamental, and statistical\u2014that have yielded varied results, but no single one or even a combination of these techniques has been shown to have the ability to successfully forecast stock price movements (Rihani and Garg, 2006).Most of our sample studies (53%) were found to belong to the first theme\u2014neural networks, their variants, and hybrids\u2014thus validating the popularity of neural networks in predicting stock market returns. Given the complexity of the financial market and the nonlinear nature of financial variables, neural networks are a significant development due to their ability to fit data, thereby dealing with complex problems (Wu and Duan, 2017). Most sample studies used single NN techniques or their variants to forecast stock market returns. Fern\u00E1ndez-Rodr\u00ED;guez et al. (2000) investigated the profitability of the basic technical trading rule based on ANNs. Cao, Leggio and Schniederjans (2005) applied ANNs to predict the stock price movements (i.e., price returns) of the firms traded on the Shanghai stock exchange. Huang et al. (2006) proposed a novel computational method suited to selecting the input for stock market forecasting using neural networks. Majhi et al. (2009) applied a trigonometric functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) model to predict the stock prices of the DJIA and S&P 500 leading stock market indices. Shen et al. (2011) used a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to train the data and forecast the Shanghai Stock Exchange's stock indices. Many studies have applied hybrid or integrated neural networks to obtain better prediction accuracy. For example, Kuo et al. (2001) developed an intelligent decision support system called a GA-based fuzzy neural network (GFNN) by combining a GA and a fuzzy neural network with an artificial neural one to measure the qualitative effect of technical indexes on the stock market. Chang et al. (2009) predicted selling and buying decision points, rather than the stock price itself, by using an integrated system, CBDWNN, that fused dynamic time windows, case-based reasoning (CBR), and neural networks. Likewise, Hsieh et al. (2011) presented an integrated system called ABC-RNN that was based on wavelet transforms, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to predict stock prices.Huarng and Yu (2006) explored ways to identify the useful lengths of intervals in fuzzy time series to improve fuzzy time series forecasting. T.-L. Chen et al. (2007) applied fuzzy time series based on the Fibonacci sequence for stock price forecasting. Cheng et al. (2006) proposed a methodology combining trend weighting with fuzzy time-series models to predict prices in the Taiwan Stock Index (TAIEX). A few studies had applied hybrid fuzzy models\u2014such as Adaptive neuro-interference systems (ANFIS) (Atsalakis and Valavanis, 2009b), fuzzy decision trees (Lai et al., 2009), fuzzy stochastic fuzzy time series (FSFTS) (Song et al., 1997), etc.\u2014to forecast stock market returns. Seven studies applied GAs to predict stock returns. However, due to their specialised feature of improving the learning algorithm itself, GAs are usually used in combination with other AI techniques such as neural networks or fuzzy systems (Kim and Han, 2000b). For example, S.-M. Chen and Chung (2006) attempted to forecast enrolments with high-order fuzzy time series and GAs, while Versace et al. (2004) predicted exchange-traded fund diamonds (DIA) by integrating GAs with neural networks.In terms of practical implications, we posit that many fund managers, portfolio managers, stock traders, and hedge fund managers working in giant investment firms and mutual fund organisations still use traditional techniques such as technical or fundamental analyses, thus making financial decisions that may not always be profitable (Weil, 2018). This is mostly seen in developing or emerging economies (Aquilina et al., 2022). Interestingly, in the US, both hedge fund managers and brokers (such as Virtu Trading, XTX Securities, and Jump Trading) use complex AI algorithms for high-frequency trading to attain abnormal returns (Burugula, 2021). These algorithms can be used in constructing portfolios by screening pools of stocks for those that meet particular criteria relating to corporate performance, valuation metrics, or trading patterns (technical analysis), or by adjusting the percentages of the constituent businesses in an index in response to certain conditions (Aquilina et al., 2022). Henceforth, fund managers, portfolio managers, stock traders, and hedge fund managers from developing countries should change with the times and adapt to the latest innovations to beat the average stock market returns. Therefore, they could adopt AI-based innovative models trained and tested by researchers and academicians on real-time data. Additionally, only 0.128% of the world population actively trades or invests in the stock market, the rest either do not have access to internet facilities or lack knowledge of financial investment (Asktraders, 2020; Singh, 2021). Most active traders or investors tread carefully in trading or investing in financial markets as they cannot correctly forecast stock prices due to high market volatility (Smales, 2017). Therefore, they need to utilise an efficient prediction model to gain confidence in investment and earn enormous profits (Hao and Gao, 2020).","Abraham, Ajith P., Hybrid intelligent systems for stock market analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2074, pp. 337-345, (2001); Abu-Mostafa, Yaser S., Introduction to financial forecasting, Applied Intelligence, 6, 3, pp. 205-213, (1996); Al-Hnaity, Bashar, Predicting financial time series data using hybrid model, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 650, pp. 19-41, (2016); Asian Journal of Finance Accounting, (2016); Aquilina, Matteo, Quantifying the High-Frequency Trading ""Arms Race, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 137, 1, pp. 493-564, (2022); Aria, Massimo, bibliometrix: An R-tool for comprehensive science mapping analysis, Journal of Informetrics, 11, 4, pp. 959-975, (2017); Armano, Giuliano, A hybrid genetic-neural architecture for stock indexes forecasting, Information Sciences, 170, 1, pp. 3-33, (2005); Asadi, Shahrokh, Hybridization of evolutionary Levenberg-Marquardt neural networks and data pre-processing for stock market prediction, Knowledge-Based Systems, 35, pp. 245-258, (2012); How Many Traders can Be Found Globally, (2020); Atsalakis, George S., Surveying stock market forecasting techniques - Part II: Soft computing methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3 PART 2, pp. 5932-5941, (2009)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01664972","","TNVTD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197596172"

Comparative analysis with HAR-RV and machine learning models based on fixed parameters demonstrates the superior predictive performance of the dynamic tuning-based model. These findings are corroborated in robustness tests. Using interpretable tools for machine learning model explanations, this study delves further into the driving factors behind the predictive performance of the dynamic tuning-based model. The results indicate that hash rate and the effective federal funds rate play significant roles among various forecasting factors. Further categorization of the forecasting factors reveals that blockchain indicators and macroeconomic indicators are more useful for predictions, while market indicators are relatively less informative. Moreover, a time-varying analysis of variable importance scores suggests a significant increase in the importance score of blockchain indicators from October 2022 onwards, coinciding with the EU passing landmark legislation on digital assets in October 2022. Finally, an economic value analysis indicates that the dynamic tuning-based model can achieve higher economic returns in practice compared to traditional fixed parameter models.

This paper introduces Factor-GAN, an innovative framework that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology for factor investing. Leveraging a comprehensive factor database comprising 70 firm characteristics, Factor-GAN integrates deep learning techniques with the multi-factor pricing model, thereby elevating the precision and stability of investment strategies. To explain the economic mechanisms underlying deep learning, we conduct a subsample analysis of the Chinese stock market. The findings reveal that the deep learning-based pricing model significantly enhances return prediction accuracy and factor investment performance in comparison to linear models. Particularly noteworthy is the superior performance of the long-short portfolio under Factor-GAN, demonstrating an annualized return of 23.52% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.29. During the transition from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to non-SOEs, our study discerns shifts in factor importance, with liquidity and volatility gaining significance while fundamental indicators diminish. Additionally, A-share listed companies display a heightened emphasis on momentum and growth indicators relative to their dual-listed counterparts.

In addition, we evaluate the primary drivers of ASEAN-4 bond markets, employing global and ASEAN-4 macroeconomic indicators and uncertainty measures to explain variations in the spillover dynamics. Empirical findings reveal strong inter-country connectedness among bond markets, with the U.S. market having the most significant links for 7- and 10-year bond maturities. However, there is limited connectedness within ASEAN-4 and other developing countries, indicating strong diversification potential. Furthermore, our findings indicate increased interconnectedness during COVID-19 and that macroeconomic fundamentals significantly influence the ASEAN-4 markets, rationalizing the heterogeneous cross-border transmission of uncertainty shocks.

As a result, using innovative decision-making strategies is expected to lead to significant returns in stock prices. Predicting the stock market proves challenging because of the limited volatility and inherent disorderliness observed within the data. Hence, investors need help optimizing their profits through informed predictions in the stock market. Stock market projections are made by employing mathematical approaches and machine learning methods. The stock market is inherently vulnerable to unforeseen changes due to its intricate nature and absence of a linear progression. Since the advent of personal computers and the proliferation of technological advancements in the 1990s, scholars have investigated the application of artificial intelligence in the investment sector. Many solutions have been created to tackle the matter of volatility in stock market prices. This study examined a total of 146 research articles that were published in academic journals over twelve years (2011-2023). These papers focused on applying artificial intelligence in predicting stock market trends. The listed works encompass several methodologies, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis. Every academic field is comprehensively explored, encompassing its initial findings and most recent advancements. Moreover, the existing body of literature suggests a growing focus on this particular sector, with a heightened level of specialization and an expanded range of topics being explored. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Finance Forecasting; Sentiment Analysis; Share Market; Trade Forecast","","","","","Abhishek, Kumar, A stock market prediction model using Artificial Neural Network, (2012); Agrawal, Manish, Stock prediction based on technical indicators using deep learning model, Computers, Materials and Continua, 70, 1, pp. 287-304, (2021); Agrawal, Ashita, Does EVA Beat ROA and ROE in Explaining the Stock Returns in Indian Scenario?

Discussions to remedy this have been ongoing for several years. We propose a new method that addresses the flaws of the current approach of the System of National Accounts. We implement a simple model-free method that removes the ’pure’ credit risk premium from the production of banks while keeping the liquidity provision as part of the total nominal bank output. Using both local projections and autoregressive distributed lag models, we show that our method produces nominal bank output estimates that are consistent with the evolution of the economic activity and that remain always positive including during periods of financial stress. This method satisfies the four conditions set by the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on National Accounts. Furthermore, our method reveals that the nominal banking output of the eurozone is overestimated by approximately 40% over the period 2003–2017. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ardl; Bank Output; Liquidity Premium; Local Projections; Risk Premium","","","","","Acharya, Viral V., A model of liquidity hoarding and term premia in inter-bank markets, Journal of Monetary Economics, 58, 5, pp. 436-447, (2011); undefined, (2012); Article Uk Office for National Statistics, (2017); Amihud, Yakov, Liquidity, Maturity, and the Yields on U.S. Treasury Securities, Journal of Finance, 46, 4, pp. 1411-1425, (1991); Athanasoglou, Panayiotis P., Assessing output and productivity growth in the banking industry, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 49, 4, pp. 1317-1340, (2009); Bao, Jack, The Illiquidity of Corporate Bonds, Journal of Finance, 66, 3, pp. 911-946, (2011); Basu, Susanto, The value of risk: Measuring the service output of U.S. Commercial banks, Economic Inquiry, 49, 1, pp. 226-245, (2011); Bazot, Guillaume, Financial consumption and the cost of finance: Measuring financial efficiency in Europe (1950-2007), Journal of the European Economic Association, 16, 1, pp. 123-160, (2018); Brunnermeier, Markus K., Deciphering the liquidity and credit crunch 2007-2008, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 23, 1, pp. 77-100, (2009); Cheung, Yin-Wong, FINITE‐SAMPLE SIZES OF JOHANSEN's LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS FOR COINTEGRATION, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 55, 3, pp. 313-328, (1993)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","10629769","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184509969"

The study focuses on understanding the repercussions of Airbnb announcements on capital markets, concentrating specifically on the travel and tourism sector and the real estate sector. The findings unveil a discernible augmentation in index returns preceding the announcement’s publication in both sectors. However, a notable divergence manifests post-announcement: while the real estate sector sustains an upward trajectory in returns, the travel and tourism sector experiences a post-publication decline. These results underscore the strategic advantage available to investors with early access to Airbnb announcements, enabling them to capitalize on excess profits. Furthermore, the broader investor community can leverage the insights gleaned from Airbnb announcements for financial gains. A nuanced examination of regression results reveals the substantial impact of macroeconomic variables on index returns in both the travel and tourism sector and the real estate sector.

Whereas the effects of financial reporting on capital suppliers’ decisions traditionally have received much attention, recent research has generated important new insights into the feedback effects of financial reporting on the reporting firms’ real activities (e.g., investments or allocation and use of resources). We identify the consequences of financial reporting for (1) the reporting firm, (2) its peer firms, and (3) the input and output markets. We also highlight the effects of firms’ internal controls over financial reporting and consider how accounting and auditing regulations influence and contribute to real effects. The studies we review are consistent in their findings that high-quality financial reporting is positively associated with the efficiency of the reporting firm's resource allocation. Many studies also suggest a positive association between high-quality financial reporting and an efficient allocation of resources in the real sector, which can also benefit other market participants like consumers or employees.

Objectives: This retrospective observational study aimed to assess the relationship between macroeconomic trends and CVD ED visits. Methods: This study uses data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey (NHAMCS), Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED), National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and CVD groupings from National Vital Statistics (NVS) and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from 1999 to 2020 to analyze ED visits in relation to macroeconomic indicators and NBER defined recessions and expansions. Results: CVD ED visits grew by 79.7% from 1999 to 2020, significantly more than total ED visits (27.8%, p < 0.001). A national estimate of 213.2 million CVD ED visits, with 22.9 million visits in economic recessions were analyzed. A secondary group including a 6-month period before and after each recession (defined as a “broadened recession”) was also analyzed to account for potential leading and lagging effects of the recession, with a total of 50.0 million visits. A significantly higher proportion of CVD ED visits related to heart failure (HF) and other acute ischemic heart diseases (IHD) was observed during recessionary time periods both directly and with a 6-month lead and lag (p < 0.05). The proportion of aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAA) and atherosclerosis (ASVD) ED visits was significantly higher (p = 0.024) in the recession period with a 6-month lead and lag. When controlled for common demographic factors, economic approximations of recession such as the CPI, federal funds rate, and real disposable income were significantly associated with increased CVD ED visits. Conclusion: Macroeconomic trends have a significant relationship with the overall mix of CVD ED visits and represent an understudied social determinant of health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cardiovascular Disease; Cpi; Cvd; Economic Recession; Economics; Economics Of Healthcare; Federal Funds Rate; Fred; Ischemic Heart Disease; Nber; Overcrowding; Sdoh; Social Determinates Of Health; Adult; Article; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular Disease; Economic Recession; Economics; Emergency Ward; Female; Human; Major Clinical Study; Male; Observational Study; Retrospective Study; Social Determinants Of Health; Aged; Emergency; Hospital Emergency Service; Medicare; United States; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Economic Recession; Emergencies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Medicare; Social Determinants Of Health","adult; Article; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; economic recession; economics; emergency ward; female; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; retrospective study; social determinants of health; aged; emergency; hospital emergency service; medicare; United States; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Economic Recession; Emergencies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Medicare; Social Determinants of Health","","","","Xu, Jiaquan, Mortality in the United States, 2021, National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, 456, pp. 1-8, (2022); Osborne, Michael T., Disentangling the Links Between Psychosocial Stress and Cardiovascular Disease, Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging, 13, 8, (2020); Kivimaki, Mika Shipley, Effects of stress on the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 15, 4, pp. 215-229, (2018); Steptoe, Andrew, Stress and cardiovascular disease, Nature Reviews Cardiology, 9, 6, pp. 360-370, (2012); Georgiades, Anastasia, Financial strain predicts recurrent events among women with coronary artery disease, International Journal of Cardiology, 135, 2, pp. 175-183, (2009); Qureshi, Farah, The social determinants of ideal cardiovascular health: A global systematic review, Annals of Epidemiology, 76, pp. 20-38, (2022); Khaing, Win, Effects of education and income on cardiovascular outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, 24, 10, pp. 1032-1042, (2017); Who Suffers During Recessions, (2012); Changes in Health Insurance Coverage in the Great Recession 2007 2010, (2011); Health Insurance Coverage in the United States 2019, (2020)","","W.B.

In this paper, we develop a China’s stock market risk early warning system. The proposed early warning system consists of three components. First, we use value at risk (VaR) to identify the stock market risk in which stock market risk is divided into multiple categories instead of two categories. Second, we construct a comprehensive indicator system in which basic indicators, technical indicators, overseas return rate indicators, and macroeconomic indicators are considered simultaneously. Third, we use four machine learning models, namely long short-term memory (LSTM), gate recurrent unit (GRU), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and EXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), to predict China’s stock market risk. Experimental results show that: (1) Considering the macroeconomic indicators and basic indicators of Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC), ShenZhen Component Index (SZCZ) and Hang Seng Index (HSI) can significantly improve the performance of predicting China’s stock market risk. (2) The opening of SH-HK Stock Connect program improves the predictive performance, but the opening of SZ-HK Stock Connect program decreases the predictive performance. (3) The indicators related to Hong Kong become more important after the SZ-HK Stock Connect program. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Early Warning System; Multiple Categories; Stock Market Risk; The Stock Connect Programs; Value At Risk; Adaptive Boosting; Commerce; Financial Markets; Long Short-term Memory; Value Engineering; Early Warning System; Hong-kong; Macroeconomic Indicators; Mainland Chinas; Market Risks; Multiple Category; Predictive Performance; Stock Market Risk; The Stock Connect Program; Value At Risk; Forecasting","Adaptive boosting; Commerce; Financial markets; Long short-term memory; Value engineering; Early Warning System; Hong-kong; Macroeconomic indicators; Mainland chinas; Market risks; Multiple category; Predictive performance; Stock market risk; The stock connect program; Value at Risk; Forecasting","","","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72071134), the Project of Teachers Constructions in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 14th Five-year Plan (No. BPHR20220120), and the Graduates Science and Technology Innovation Project of Capital University of Economics and Business.","Altan, Aytaç, Digital currency forecasting with chaotic meta-heuristic bio-inspired signal processing techniques, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 126, pp. 325-336, (2019); Antunes, António A., Forecasting banking crises with dynamic panel probit models, International Journal of Forecasting, 34, 2, pp. 249-275, (2018); Bai, Ye, Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect: An analysis of Chinese partial stock market liberalization impact on the local and foreign markets, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 50, pp. 182-203, (2017); Barrell, Ray J., Bank regulation, property prices and early warning systems for banking crises in OECD countries, Journal of Banking and Finance, 34, 9, pp. 2255-2264, (2010); Berg, Andrew G., Are currency crises predictable?

K., College of Business and Economics, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","Technical analysis in the foreign exchange (Forex) market has yielded mixed results, particularly regarding its effectiveness over different holding periods in swing trading. This study addresses this gap by evaluating 497 technical trading rules across 10 currencies over 22 years (January 2000 to December 2022). Focusing on swing trading windows of 1-7 days, the research introduces the concept of an ‘optimal holding period,’ examining how price movements align with trading signals at varying time lags post-signal. The results demonstrate that technical trading rules significantly predict price movements in both developed and emerging market currencies, with emerging markets showing higher levels of predictability. Notably, simple moving average (SMA) indicators perform most effectively for emerging market currencies, while oscillator-based strategies prove more successful for developed markets. These findings have practical implications for Forex traders employing short-term strategies, providing actionable insights for optimizing trade timing. Additionally, the study opens new avenues for future research on the role of technical analysis in enhancing trading performance in global currency markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economics; Finance; Financial Management; Forex; Holding Period; International Finance; Moving Averages; Quantitative Finance; Relative Strength Index; Technical Analysis; Trading Signal","","","","","Ahmed, Salman, FLF-LSTM: A novel prediction system using Forex Loss Function, Applied Soft Computing, 97, (2020); Bis Triennial Central Bank Survey, (2022); Bessembinder, Hendrik, The profitability of technical trading rules in the Asian stock markets, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 3, 2-3, pp. 257-284, (1995); Chan, Raymond Hon Fu, Financial Mathematics, Derivatives and Structured Products, pp. 1-395, (2019); Coakley, Jerry, How profitable are FX technical trading rules?, International Review of Financial Analysis, 45, pp. 273-282, (2016); Review of Economics and Statistics, (1978); Deng, Shangkun, The profitability of Ichimoku Kinkohyo based trading rules in stock markets and FX markets, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26, 4, pp. 5321-5336, (2021); Dockery, Everton, Further evidence on the returns to technical trading rules: Insights from fourteen currencies, Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 69, (2023); Journal of Business, (1966); Journal of Business, (1965)","","Cogent OA","","","","","","23311975","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209914642"

In this study, we propose an AI-driven ensemble model called the multi-model dynamic prediction system (MMDPS) to enhance exchange rate forecasting accuracy, prediction direction consistency, and prediction robustness. To that end, we implemented a series of measures. First, the submodels of MMDPS apply fuzzy prediction, chaos prediction, deep learning, and linear time-series forecasting methods to enhance the information extraction capability of MMDPS. Second, we introduced an innovative hybrid wavelet denoising method to enhance the ability of MMDPS to handle noise in exchange rate data. Third, we employed a novel multi-objective metaheuristic optimization algorithm to determine the optimal combination weights, optimizing across the dimensions of predictive accuracy and directional consistency. This approach further enhances the generalization capability and predictive robustness of MMDPS. Finally, we incorporated into MMDPS multiple variables that are closely related to exchange rates and can rapidly reflect market changes, such as panic indices and commodity futures prices, to enhance the model’s predictive robustness against uncertainty shocks. The predictive performance of MMDPS was validated using 15 datasets with varying frequencies. The results of our experiments demonstrate that MMDPS significantly outperforms the benchmark models in terms of prediction accuracy, consistency in prediction direction, and predictive robustness. Furthermore, MMDPS can significantly enhance investor returns and mitigate investment risks, which underscore its critical application value. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ensemble Model; Exchange Rate; Machine Learning; Prediction; Uncertainty Shock","","","","This paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (72104046), Major Project of the National Social Science Fund (22&ZD159), Statistical Science Key Research Program of China (2023LZ032), Liaoning Provincial Social Science Fund Key Discipline Construction Project (L24ZD038), and Graduate Research Innovation Special Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department.","undefined, (2021); Barman, Haripriya, Inventory model involving reworking of faulty products with three carbon policies under neutrosophic environment, Advanced Engineering Informatics, 57, (2023); Breen, John David, The predictive content of oil price and volatility: New evidence on exchange rate forecasting, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 75, (2021); Cheung, Yin-Wong, Empirical exchange rate models of the nineties: Are any fit to survive?, Journal of International Money and Finance, 24, 7, pp. 1150-1175, (2005); Das, Smruti Rekha, A hybridized ELM using self-adaptive multi-population-based Jaya algorithm for currency exchange prediction: an empirical assessment, Neural Computing and Applications, 31, 11, pp. 7071-7094, (2019); Debnath, Kaushik, Power partitioned neutral aggregation operators for T-spherical fuzzy sets: An application to H2 refuelling site selection, Expert Systems with Applications, 216, (2023); Diebold, Francis X., Comparing predictive accuracy, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 13, 3, pp. 253-263, (1995); Engel, Charles M., The forward discount anomaly and the risk premium: A survey of recent evidence, Journal of Empirical Finance, 3, 2, pp. 123-192, (1996); Engel, Charles M., Forecasting the U.S. Dollar in the 21st Century, Journal of International Economics, 141, (2023); Feng, Wenjun, Currency exchange rate predictability: The new power of Bitcoin prices, Journal of International Money and Finance, 132, (2023)","","Springer","","","","","","15729338; 02545330","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204902557"

Findings: Financial stress is having a prodigious effect on the economic growth of select economies. From the data analysis, it is found that the long-memory effect is noted in the gross domestic product (GDP) for India and Korea only, which implies that the volatility in the GDP series for these two nations demonstrates persistence and dependency on previous values over a lengthy period.

The results of GMM and fixed effects models reveal that cryptocurrencies and gold prices have a significant and negative impact on stock market performance. In addition, empirical findings also highlight that during COVID-19, the influence of cryptocurrencies and gold prices on the stock market was much greater (1.5% cryptocurrencies and 1.7% gold prices) compared to the pre-COVID-19 timeline (1.3% cryptocurrencies and 1.1% gold prices).

Arbitrage Pricing Theory identifies the risk factors likely to impact crude oil returns. Subsequently, Quantile Regression estimates the relationship between the selected factors and the returns across different distribution quantiles. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price is used in this study as a benchmark for crude oil prices. WTI’s price fluctuations can significantly impact the performance of global crude oil stocks and, subsequently, the global economy. Various statistical measures are used in this study to determine the proposed model's stability. The results show that changes in WTI returns can have varying effects depending on market conditions and levels of volatility. This study emphasizes the influence of structural discontinuities on returns. These are likely generated by changes in the global economy and the unpredictable demand for crude oil during the pandemic. The inclusion of pandemic, geopolitical, and inflation-related explanatory variables adds uniqueness to the study as it considers current global events that can affect crude oil returns. Findings show that the key factors that pose significant risks to returns are industrial production, inflation, the global price of energy, the shape of the yield curve, and global economic policy uncertainty. This implies that while making investment decisions in WTI futures, investors should pay particular attention to these elements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arbitrage Pricing Theory; Crude Oil; Econometric Model; Quantile-regression; Risk Management; Statistical Methods","","","","","Zhao, Lutao, Dynamic impacts of online investor sentiment on international crude oil prices, Resources Policy, 82, (2023); Zhang, Wenting, Crude oil market and stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the US, Japan, and Germany, International Review of Financial Analysis, 74, (2021); Zhang, Xiang, Oil price uncertainty and cash holdings: Evidence from China, Energy Economics, 87, (2020); Yu, Mengyan, Exploring the nexus between monetary uncertainty and volatility in global crude oil: A contemporary approach of regime-switching, Resources Policy, 85, (2023); Xiao, Zhijie, Quantile regression and value at risk, pp. 1143-1167, (2015); Wei, Yu, Oil price fluctuation, stock market and macroeconomic fundamentals: Evidence from China before and after the financial crisis, Finance Research Letters, 30, pp. 23-29, (2019); Wang, Kaihua, Is the oil price a barometer of China's automobile market?

The analysis makes use of a novel machine learning algorithm, working in high-dimensional graphical models, to select, among the multitude of potential determinants, the relevant explanatory variables for the number of innovative start-ups. Being the variables involved in the analysis sampled at different frequencies, mixed data sampling models are employed for estimation and forecasting purposes. The need to reduce the number of regressors of these models, for reasons related to their estimability, is met by resorting to principal component analysis of the potential determinants. An empirical application to the set of Italian innovative start-ups, either in their entirety or split according to some specific requirements, highlights the effectiveness of this approach. The analysis results provides useful information for the assessment of national innovation policies and for the evaluation of the capability of the innovative start-ups to persist and contribute at the recovery during the actual crisis still affected by the pandemic. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19; Innovative Start-ups; Midas; U-midas; Variable Selection","","","","","undefined, (2005); Acosta, Manuel, University spillovers and new business location in high-technology sectors: Spanish evidence, Small Business Economics, 36, 3, pp. 365-376, (2011); Ács, Zoltán J., Employment effects of business dynamics: Mice, Gazelles and Elephants, Small Business Economics, 30, 1, pp. 85-100, (2008); Iosr Journal of Humanities and Social Science, (2016); undefined, (1990); Aghion, Philippe, Chapter 2 Growth with Quality-Improving Innovations: An Integrated Framework, Handbook of Economic Growth, 1, SUPPL.

Exploring the impact mechanisms between oil prices and industries is particularly important for accurate forecasting of crude oil prices. As one of the world's largest commodity consumers, China's crude oil market is more representative and susceptible to external factors than that of developed countries. In this paper, we propose an analytical forecasting framework based on the causal effects between Shanghai crude oil prices and various industries in China to improve the forecasting accuracy of crude oil prices. Information geometric causal inference (IGCI) is applied to detect causal relationships between 31 different industries in China and Shanghai crude oil prices in the three time periods before, during and after COVID-19, and industries with strong causal information effects on crude oil prices in the long run are screened out as additional features. An oil price forecasting model based on Gray Wolf Optimization and Extreme Learning Machine (GWO-ELM) is proposed. Considering the small amount of data for Shanghai crude oil, this paper proposes a cross-learning data approach to solve the problem. Experimental results show that the GWO-ELM model outperforms RF, LSTM, GRU, and migration learning-based Tr-LSTM and Tr-Adaboost models in the task of Shanghai crude oil futures price prediction, and find that industry characteristics with long-term causal effects on oil prices can improve the model prediction accuracy. Our proposed analytical prediction can capture the oil price trend more accurately through the information of the industry and solve the problem of insufficient training data for the model. The application of this framework is expected to provide new methods and ideas for data mining of crude oil and other futures prices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-learning Data; Crude Oil Price; Extreme Learning Machine; Gray Wolf Optimization; Industry Sector; Information Geometric Causal Inference","","","","","Selmi, Refk, Managing exposure to volatile oil prices: Evidence from U.S. sectoral and industry-level data, Resources Policy, 73, (2021); Leong, Soonheng, Global crude oil and the Chinese oil-intensive sectors: A comprehensive causality study, Energy Economics, 103, (2021); Sun, Yanning, An adaptive fault detection and root-cause analysis scheme for complex industrial processes using moving window KPCA and information geometric causal inference, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 32, 7, pp. 2007-2021, (2021); Janzing, Dominik, Information-geometric approach to inferring causal directions, Artificial Intelligence, 182-183, pp. 1-31, (2012); Zhang, Yongjie, The role of investor attention in predicting stock prices: The long short-term memory networks perspective, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Zhang, Tingting, Multi-step-ahead crude oil price forecasting based on two-layer decomposition technique and extreme learning machine optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm, Energy, 229, (2021); Busari, Ganiyu Adewale, Crude oil price prediction: A comparison between AdaBoost-LSTM and AdaBoost-GRU for improving forecasting performance, Computers and Chemical Engineering, 155, (2021); Chen, Yanhui, Multi-step-ahead crude oil price forecasting using a hybrid grey wave model, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 501, pp. 98-110, (2018); Wu, Yuxi, Improved EEMD-based crude oil price forecasting using LSTM networks, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 516, pp. 114-124, (2019); Das, Sudeepa, Stock market forecasting using intrinsic time-scale decomposition in fusion with cluster based modified CSA optimized ELM, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 34, 10, pp. 8777-8793, (2022)","","World Scientific","","","","","","17936780; 02194775","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172918492"

Based on the mean and quantile spillover index of time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR), we measure the spillover effects among crude oil, commodity market, and inflation in China under normal and extreme conditions from April 2018 to January 2023. The results show the interdependence among crude oil, commodity markets, and inflation; however, the degree of correlation varies at different quantiles. Notably, the spillover index is significantly higher at the extreme quantile, indicating that extreme risks can easily affect the spillover effect among crude oil, commodity markets, and inflation. Meanwhile, the tail risk spillover effect among crude oil, commodity markets, and inflation exhibits asymmetry, indicating that the spillover effect is greater during downward market conditions than upward ones. Furthermore, oil prices serve as a significant provider of systemic risk, both in normal market conditions and during times of extreme risk. In most cases, oil prices transfer more risks to inflation and commodity markets, commodity markets transfer more risks to inflation, and the paired spillover effects between commodity markets fluctuate over time. Finally, our results hold significant implications for investors, market regulators, and policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodity Market; Crude Oil; Inflation; Quantile Regression; Tvp-var; Commerce; Costs; Economic And Social Effects; Financial Markets; Investments; Value Engineering; Auto-regressive; Commodities Market; Inflation; Market Condition; Oil Prices; Parameter Vectors; Quantile Regression; Spillover Effects; Time Varying Parameter; Time-varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive; Crude Oil; Commodity Market; Crude Oil; Inflation; Price Dynamics; Risk Assessment; Spillover Effect; Vector Autoregression; China","Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Financial markets; Investments; Value engineering; Auto-regressive; Commodities market; Inflation; Market condition; Oil Prices; Parameter vectors; Quantile regression; Spillover effects; Time varying parameter; Time-varying parameter vector autoregressive; Crude oil; commodity market; crude oil; inflation; price dynamics; risk assessment; spillover effect; vector autoregression; China","","","Funding for this research from National Social Science Foundation of China with ratification number 21BGL022 is gratefully acknowledged.

Based on the results of the Unit root test and Granger causality test, there are bidirectional relationships between risk and capital structure and vice versa. Additionally, Panel DOLS and System GMM were applied for regression and comparison analysis between the African markets and South Africa. The estimates disclose that when companies experience lower risk, the costs of adjustment toward the target are higher. Hence, companies can re-adjust their capital structure more easily by issuing external capital over periods of stable economic environments, thereby improving their market value. Considering the case of South Africa, the first DOLS results outlined similar estimates compared to the African market. Conversely, when measured with System GMM, the estimates imply that firms incur difficulties in adjusting costs, thus reducing leverage due to unfavorable macroeconomic indicators in line with the pecking order theory stating that in African economies, companies spend more on expenses and adjust their capital structure slowly to reach their optimal target position. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","African Markets; Capital Structure Adjustments; Risk","","","","","Allini, Alessandra, Pecking order and market timing theory in emerging markets: The case of Egyptian firms, Research in International Business and Finance, 44, pp. 297-308, (2018); Al-Najjar, Basil, Empirical modelling of capital structure: Jordanian evidence, Journal of Emerging Market Finance, 10, 1, pp. 1-19, (2011); Alti, Aydoǧan, How persistent is the impact of market timing on capital structure?, Journal of Finance, 61, 4, pp. 1681-1710, (2006); Amelot, Lydie Myriam Marcelle, Impact of idiosyncratic and macroeconomic risks on capital structure: evidence from SADC countries, African Journal of Economic and Management Studies, 12, 3, pp. 400-422, (2021); J Acc Finan, (2017); International Journal of Business and Social Science, (2001); Badenhoop, Jay K., Natural steric analysis of internal rotation barriers, International Journal of Quantum Chemistry, 72, 4, pp. 269-280, (1999); Baker, Malcolm P., Market timing and capital structure, Journal of Finance, 57, 1, pp. 1-32, (2002); Bandyopadhyay, Arindam, Factors determining capital structure and corporate performance in India: Studying the business cycle effects, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 61, pp. 160-172, (2016); Baum, Christopher F., The effects of uncertainty on the leverage of nonfinancial firms, Economic Inquiry, 47, 2, pp. 216-225, (2009)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","10448136; 10970053","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159097171"

Wavelet coherence plots are employed to examine the interdependence of oil prices with Nifty and exchange rates and to analyse the time series information at different times and frequencies. The results also report the existence of long-run relations using Johansen's cointegration test and vector error correction model. Moreover, the shocks in one variable have been noticed with a persistent and prolonged effect on other variables. However, the results explain that these shocks have short-term effects, but in the long run, the market becomes stable.

We concentrate specifically on Switzerland and Sweden. We use correlation analysis to reveal the relationship between interest rates and GDP, the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) and some indicators of banks’ performance. We found that negative interest rates (NIRs) are strongly correlated with the level of GDP in both Switzerland and Sweden but that they do not affect their FDI. The share of banks´ deposits in GDP is also strongly correlated with NIR. Other indicators of bank performance do not show a strong correlation for both countries. Our evidence is consistent with NIR not being associated with undesirable effects concerning economic growth and bank performance in Switzerland and Sweden. The value of FDI depends on many factors—mainly on the attractiveness of a country for foreign investors in terms of its political and economic stability and by general conditions for business operation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banks’ Performance; Fdi; Gdp; Negative Interest Rate Policy; Sweden; Switzerland","","","","The result was created by solving the student project “Financial sector in the third decade of the 21st century” using objective-oriented support for specific university research from the University of Finance and Administration.","Altavilla, Carlo, Is there a zero lower bound?

Literature shows that a single model algorithm usually cannot perform satisfactorily on the foreign exchange (Forex) time series because of the market's complexity. This study develops an algorithm based on two stacked generalization models consisting of four machine-learning models. First, the optimal lags of features are found using the Fisher discriminant ratio and partial autocorrelation function. Second, one stacked model fits the bullish trends, and the other holds the bearish trends resulting from a hidden Markov model. We reinforce the predictive signals of these models by extracting relationships between currency pairs with correlation and mutual information. Lastly, the proposed algorithm constructs a portfolio based on the strength of signals dependent on correlation and mutual information. As a result, this paper compares the performance of the proposed approach with different states of the model and several established benchmarks regarding return and risk metrics. The outcomes show that the proposed model's added features—such as time series clustering, considering a range of inputs, and internal relationships among different assets—can increase its performance in the Forex market. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Foreign Exchange Market; Hidden Markov Model; Stacked Generalization Model; Time Series Clustering; Time Series Forecasting","","","","","Ahmed, Salman, FLF-LSTM: A novel prediction system using Forex Loss Function, Applied Soft Computing, 97, (2020); Alam, Md Samsul, Causal flows between oil and forex markets using high-frequency data: Asymmetries from good and bad volatility, Energy Economics, 84, (2019); Bates Jm, COMBINATION OF FORECASTS, Operational Research Quarterly, 20, 4, pp. 451-468, (1969); Inequalities, (1972); Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, (2006); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Broock, W.

They are considered as significant predictors for numerous macro-economic variables, nevertheless their role in terms of affecting food prices is not widely explored. Therefore, the study aims to examine the nexus between food and oil price by applying the advanced econometric technique quantile on quantile regression (QnQ) and monthly data from January 1993 to September 2020. To attain a broader aspect, we categorize oil prices into supply and demand shocks while food price index into sub-indices such as Meat price index (MI), Dairy price index (DI), Cereal price index (CI), Sugar price index (SI), Corn price index (COPI), Soybean price index (SOPI) and Wheat price index (WOPI). The findings reveal positive association between the food prices and indices across the quantiles. In the case of an oil demand shock, a stronger relationship is observed between the extremely high and low quantiles especially in dairy, meat, food indexes while corn, soybean and wheat indicate a stronger relationship in lower quantiles. According to the oil prices, a stronger relationship is observed on the extremely low quantiles, in the case of cereal, dairy, meat and corn price indexes. Conversely, a stronger relationship is observed between the extremely low and high quantiles in the food price index. In accordance with the oil supply shock, a stronger relationship is observed on the extremely low quantiles in cereal and dairy indexes; and a stronger relationship is observed on the extreme middle quantiles in the food prices index. While a stronger relationship is observed on the extreme middle quantiles in terms of corn, soybean and wheat price. The result confirms variation in variables dependency, and the extremely positive effects are noted in the lower and middle quantiles. The outcome of this study will benefit the policymakers of the agricultural sector in developing reliable and comprehensive policy designs that will control the influence of oil prices on food prices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Food Prices And Indices; Graphical Representation; Oil Demand Shock; Oil Prices; Oil Supply Shock; Quantile On Quantile Regression; Costs; Economics; Oils And Fats; Regression Analysis; Asymmetric Effects; Food Price And Index; Food Prices; Graphical Representations; Oil Demand Shocks; Oil Prices; Oil Supply Shocks; Price Index; Quantile On Quantile Regression; Quantile Regression; Meats; Asymmetry; Demand Analysis; Econometrics; Food Industry; Maize; Oil Supply; Price Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Soybean; Wheat","Costs; Economics; Oils and fats; Regression analysis; Asymmetric effects; Food price and index; Food prices; Graphical representations; Oil demand shocks; Oil Prices; Oil supply shocks; Price index; Quantile on quantile regression; Quantile regression; Meats; asymmetry; demand analysis; econometrics; food industry; maize; oil supply; price dynamics; regression analysis; soybean; wheat","","","","Zmami, Mourad, Does oil price drive world food prices?

The economic benefits realized by ship operators who apply our forecasting rules exceed those derived from the fixed policy approach of using either alternative, and will be used to disprove the validity of the efficient market hypothesis. The paper applies the regression methodology and forecasts two steps ahead of quarterly spot prices regressed recursively on fixed variables, thus extending research in terms of the scope of analysis. We have applied statistical evaluation in addition to the economic evaluation and found that the proposed model outperforms the historical mean forecast. This paper emphasizes the importance of a sound diversification strategy within the business platform to target the more profitable business segment and test if macroeconomic indicators and commodity prices are satisfactory indicators for forecasting charter hire rate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Charter Hire Rate Forecast; Decision-making Process; Efficient Market; Time Charter; Trip Charter","","","","","Ang, Andrew, Stock return predictability: Is it there?, Review of Financial Studies, 20, 3, pp. 651-707, (2007); Interpreting Cointegrated Models Scholarly Articles 3221492, (1988); Marine Decisions Under Uncertainty, (1971); Journal of Political Economy, (1988); Henkel, Sam James, Time-varying short-horizon predictability, Journal of Financial Economics, 99, 3, pp. 560-580, (2011); Lettau, Martin, Reconciling the return predictability evidence, Review of Financial Studies, 21, 4, pp. 1607-1652, (2008); Market Design the Policy Uses of Theory, (2003); Swedish Journal of Economics, (1968); Studies in Shipping Economics in Honour of Professor Arnljot Stromme Svendsen, (1982); Paye, Bradley S., Instability of return prediction models, Journal of Empirical Finance, 13, 3, pp. 274-315, (2006)","","Faculty of Maritime Studies","","","","","","18483305; 18483313","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163966206"

The results show that the dependencies within cryptocurrencies are highly symmetric and sensitive to different quantile arrangements. Under normal market conditions, we find a high positive dependence within cryptocurrencies and a low positive dependence between cryptocurrencies and gold. The dependence is higher at long term than intermediate- and short- terms before the pandemic during bearish market conditions. In contrast, the degree of dependence decreases at the intermediate- and long-terms during COVID-19 period than before. Moreover, the magnitude of return spillovers is higher at lower quantile (bearish market) than upper quantile (bullish market).

With the upsurge in the cases, the country recorded high unemployment rates, economic uncertainties and slugging growth rates. This adversely affected the real estate sector in India. As the relation of the housing market with the gross domestic product is quite lasting thus, the decline in housing prices has severely impacted the economic growth of the nation. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to gauge the asymmetric impact of COVID-19 shocks on housing prices in India. Design/methodology/approach: Studies revealed the symmetric impact of macroeconomic variables, and contingencies on housing prices dominate the literature. However, the assumption of linearity fails to apprehend the asymmetric dynamics of the housing sector. Thus, the author uses a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model to address this limitation and test the existence of short- and long-run asymmetry. Findings: The findings revealed the long- and short-run asymmetric impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the peak of the COVID-19 on housing prices. The results indicate that the peak of COVID-19 had a greater impact on housing prices in comparison to the outbreak of COVID-19. This can be explained as prices will revert to normal at a speed of 0.978% with the decline in the number of COVID-19 cases. Whereas the housing prices rise at a rate of 0.714 as a result of government intervention to deal with the ill effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, it can be inferred that both the outbreak and peak of COVID-19 will lead to a minimal decline in housing prices, while with the decline in the number of cases and reduction in the impact of the outbreak of COVID, the housing prices will rise at an increasing rate. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to understand the impact of the outbreak and peak of COVID-19 on the housing prices separately. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric Relationship; Control Variables; Housing Prices; India; Nardl Model; Outbreak Of Covid-19; Peak Of Covid-19","","","","Author’s declaration contribution: Niharika Mehta – Identified the gap, collected data, performed analysis, reviewed literature, performed analyses and wrote the conclusion.

The strategy, which can be used as an alternative to traditional quantitative momentum ranking models, generates returns up to 27.3% per annum over the out-of-sample period from January 2010 to December 2019 and achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.3 after accounting for transaction costs on daily data.

The study uses the panel data of 38 countries from 2004 to 2018. The study finds that in the whole sample and the sub-set of developing countries, both in the long and short run, a large proportion of foreign investors is associated with a reduction in domestic government bond yields. However, an analysis of foreign investment's effect on the bond yield's volatility brought significant results only in the short run, while there is no substantial evidence of any long-run effects. The PMG methodology in this study allows differentiation between the long- and short-run relationships between foreign ownership and bond yield and yield volatility. Our sample allows the analysis and comparison of these relationships in developed and developing countries.

Nowadays, the majority of approaches and methods are formed with the obligatory use of expert assessment methods, which, in its turn, predetermines relatively subjective judgments and results. In the process of conducting a comprehensive analysis of financial and economic indicators and those reflecting the results of economic activity of gas distribution network operators functioning in the western region of Ukraine, the following approaches have been used in our study with the involvement of: Altman’s two-factor model; Altman’s five-factor model; Lis’s bankruptcy prediction model; Richard Taffler’s model; Beaver’s coefficient; Tereshchenko’s model and Matviychuk’s model; however, the existing models for diagnosing bankruptcy of enterprises are characterized by ambiguity; as for example, if Lis’s model indicates a low bankruptcy level, then other models prove the opposite situation; domestic diagnostic models need to be improved, as they were developed in the early 2000s and disregard current trends in functioning of enterprises. Since the existing models for diagnosing the bankruptcy of enterprises are characterized by ambiguity, the authors proposed and approbate their own approach to determining the level of competitiveness of gas distribution network operators. A feature of the proposed methodology is taking into account modern trends in the functioning of enterprises, taking into account the peculiarities of the activities of gas distribution network operators, and the market stage. A tangible advantage of this approach is the ability to identify the presence or likelihood of critical events at an early stage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assessment Of The Level Of Competitiveness; Bankruptcy; Competitiveness; Gas Distribution Network Operators (gdno); Natural Gas Market; Commerce; Competition; Gas Industry; Gases; Assessment Of The Level Of Competitiveness; Bankruptcy; Competitiveness; Distribution Network Operators; Enterprise Is; Gas Distribution Network; Gas Distribution Network Operator; Natural Gas Markets; S Models; Ukraine; Energy Resources","Commerce; Competition; Gas industry; Gases; Assessment of the level of competitiveness; Bankruptcy; Competitiveness; Distribution network operators; Enterprise IS; Gas distribution network; Gas distribution network operator; Natural gas markets; S models; Ukraine; Energy resources","","","","Malynovska, Yulia, Enhancing the Activity of Employees of the Communication Department of an Energy Sector Company, Energies, 15, 13, (2022); Int Sci J Internauka Ser Econ Sci, (2022); Prokopenko, Olha V., Improving state support schemes for the sustainable development of renewable energy in Ukraine, Polityka Energetyczna, 24, 1, pp. 85-100, (2021); Sotnyk, Iryna M., Energy security assessment of emerging economies under global and local challenges, Energies, 14, 18, (2021); Sotnyk, Iryna M., Determining the Optimal Directions of Investment in Regional Renewable Energy Development, Energies, 15, 10, (2022); Trela, Mariusz, Comparing the support systems for renewable energy sources in Poland green certificates vs auction systems, Polityka Energetyczna, 20, 2, pp. 105-116, (2017); Ballester, Laura, The role of internal corporate governance mechanisms on default risk: A systematic review for different institutional settings, Research in International Business and Finance, 54, (2020); Abid, Ilyes, A new approach to deal with variable selection in neural networks: an application to bankruptcy prediction, Annals of Operations Research, 313, 2, pp. 605-623, (2022); Civelek, Mehmet, The usage of technology-enabled marketing tools by smes and their bankruptcy concerns: Evidence from visegrad countries, Acta Montanistica Slovaca, 25, 3, pp. 263-273, (2020); Altman, Edward I., ZETATM analysis A new model to identify bankruptcy risk of corporations, Journal of Banking and Finance, 1, 1, pp. 29-54, (1977)","","MDPI","","","","","","19961073","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149179016"

Consumer confidence played a positive and statistically significant role in the development of expenditures especially on durable and semi-durable goods and services. The increase in cognitive, affective and eudaimonic measures of well-being, measured by the Cantril ladder, positive and negative affect and freedom to make life choices variables, had negative impact on total consumption and expenditures on semi-durable goods and services. Possible explanations for these estimates are provided in the paper. Based on the purpose of expenditure, consumer confidence was a significant determinant of all expenditures except for unavoidable spending such as food, health, housing, water, energy, and fuel. The subjective well-being indicators showed a negative impact on expenditures on clothing and footwear, recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels.

Although numerous and effective artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to time series analysis, the prediction of exchange rate movements in the Forex market still necessitates parsimonious, interpretable, and accurate solutions. This paper presents a novel methodology for predicting the short-term directional movement of the euro-dollar exchange rate using market data, specifically by measuring price action. The proposed methodology prioritizes using market inflection points and the multidimensional nature of the differences between uptrends and downtrends to construct a linear discriminant function (LDA). The core of our methodology is our novel Linear Classifier Configurator (LCC) which includes stages for data preparation, feature selection, and detection of underlying structures. We validate the results and interpretations using the statistical power of parametric tests. The experiments use market data of the euro-dollar exchange rate in 15-minute and 1-week time frames. Additionally, we incorporate a collection of intraday winning trades provided by an algorithmic trading model applied between January 1999 and April 2023. The proposed LCC methodology achieves an out-of-sample classification accuracy of 98.77%, outperforming other methodologies based on sophisticated approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), Wavelet analysis (WA), Sentiment analysis of textual content, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Furthermore, our methodology improves financial performance and reduces risk exposure in trading strategies, as well as it is useful in selecting variables and transferable to other financial assets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Foreign Exchange Market (forex); Linear Discriminant Analysis (lda); Machine Learning (ml); Supervised Learning (sl); Time Series Forecasting (tsf); Trading Systems; Behavioral Research; Commerce; Decision Making; Discriminant Analysis; Electronic Trading; Financial Markets; Forecasting; Genetic Algorithms; Investments; Long Short-term Memory; Market Research; Risk Management; Sentiment Analysis; Time Series Analysis; Exchange Rates; Foreign Exchange Market; Linear Discriminant Analyse; Linear Discriminant Analyze; Machine Learning; Machine-learning; Market Researches; Predictive Models; Supervised Learning; Support Vectors Machine; Time Series Forecasting; Trading Systems; Support Vector Machines","Behavioral research; Commerce; Decision making; Discriminant analysis; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Long short-term memory; Market Research; Risk management; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis; Exchange rates; Foreign exchange market; Linear discriminant analyse; Linear discriminant analyze; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Market researches; Predictive models; Supervised learning; Support vectors machine; Time series forecasting; Trading systems; Support vector machines","","","","Ilzetzki, Ethan, Why is the euro punching below its weight?, Economic Policy, 35, 103, pp. 405-460, (2020); Ayadi, Mohamed A., Senior official speech attributes and foreign exchange risk around business cycles, International Review of Financial Analysis, 80, (2022); Eiamkanitchat, Narissara, Fundamental analysis and technical analysis integrated system for stock filtration, Cluster Computing, 20, 1, pp. 883-894, (2017); Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, (1997); Journal of Finance, (1970); Woo, Kai Yin, Review on efficiency and anomalies in stock markets, Economies, 8, 1, (2020); Griffin, John M., Do market efficiency measures yield correct inferences?

A multilevel regression model was used for 823 companies listed on major Latin American stock exchanges over the period 2004-2018. The results showed that firm level is the most responsible factor for the variation in companies’ capital structure, while country level had the greatest influence on the variation in long-term debt. In the absence of CG mechanisms, sovereign rating is one of the factors not controlled by managers that can explain the capital structure of Latin American companies, which reduce their debt levels to protect themselves in the face of their countries’ sovereign rating variations. The results indicated that, despite having an audit committee and keeping independent members on the committee, firms choose to reduce their debt levels to protect themselves against the constant variations of their countries’ sovereign rating. The results also showed that CG mechanisms do not act in isolation when it comes to reducing agency problems.

Numerous articles recognize the influence of macroeconomic variables on the stock market and value this knowledge as essential for good investment management. However, there are very few empirical studies that justify the influence of disaggregated macroeconomic variables on the stock market in Spain and vice versa. This article uses the general index of the Madrid Stock Exchange as a proxy variable of the stock market and numerous macroeconomic variables, analyzing monthly data from January 2001 to December 2020 from various published data sources. A descriptive analysis is carried out and a vector autoregressive model (VAR) is applied. Finally, the causality is analyzed identifying the transmission of effects between them. The results confirm the impact of lagged interest rate, monetary aggregate M1 and unemployment rate on the stock market but also identify new features, such as the influence of the stock market on the interest rate, industrial production index, manufacturing activity index and economic sentiment index. This research is useful for Public Administration to detect possible risks in the economy, and it enables investors to better manage their investments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causality Granger; Macroeconomic Variables; Spain; Stock Market; Var Model; Granger Causality Test; Investment; Macroeconomics; Stock Market; Vector Autoregression; Spain","Granger causality test; investment; macroeconomics; stock market; vector autoregression; Spain","","","","International Journal of Business and Finance Research, (2013); Journal of Business Economics Research, (2007); International Journal of Business and Management, (2009); African Journal of Business Management, (2010); Asian Journal of Business Environment, (2021); Sletme Fakultesi Dergisi, (2020); Aristei, David, Sovereign bond yield spreads and market sentiment and expectations: Empirical evidence from Euro area countries, Journal of Economics and Business, 76, C, pp. 55-84, (2014); Asriyan, Vladimir, Monetary Policy for a Bubbly World, Review of Economic Studies, 88, 3, pp. 1418-1456, (2021); Forson, Joseph Ato, Selected macroeconomic variables and stock market movements: Empirical evidence from Thailand, Contemporary Economics, 8, 2, pp. 157-174, (2014); Augustin, Patrick, Sovereign to Corporate Risk Spillovers, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 50, 5, pp. 857-891, (2018)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","1331677X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149913275"

For this purpose, this study uses both autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and quantile ARDL (QARDL) models. The findings based on the ARDL model indicate that, in the long-run, foreign direct investment (FDI), trade balance and industrial production index (IPI) significantly affect emerging stock indices. In addition, the findings based on the QARDL model indicate that the short-run effect of FDI, consumer price index, interest rate and exchange rate varies across bullish, bearish and normal states of the emerging stock markets, whereas the long-run effect varies for all macroeconomic variables except IPI. These findings indicate that the results change when QARDL model is used; however, these findings remain same across seven emerging stock indices.

The study contributed to extant studies by looking at the separate effect of domestic and foreign debts on inflation and exchange rate. We adopted a battery of econometric tools such as the Driscoll–Kraay standard errors and the dynamic panel threshold model. The results show that foreign debts worsen the inflation rate and expose the economy to unanticipated movements in the exchange rate, whereas domestic debts help to reduce the inflationary pressure. The study also found a nonlinear relationship between public debts and macroeconomic indicators of inflation and exchange rates. This implies the further accumulation of foreign debt will heighten the inflation rate and expose the region to unanticipated movements in the exchange rate. The study recommends that governments and policymakers in SSA should ensure that foreign debts are sufficiently hedged against currency and interest rate risks to reduce the exposure of SSA economies to exchange rate risks. The study also recommends that governments adhere strictly to the maximum debt limit of 60.59% (of gross domestic product), otherwise inflation and exchange rates may worsen. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domestic Debts; Exchange Rate; Foreign Debts; Inflation; Public Debt; Debt; Exchange Rate; Inflation; Interest Rate; Macroeconomics; Sub-saharan Africa","debt; exchange rate; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics; Sub-Saharan Africa","","","","Abbas, S.

In this paper, we propose a method for the detection of lead–lag clusters of time series in multivariate systems. We demonstrate that the web of pairwise lead–lag relationships between time series can be helpfully construed as a directed network, for which there exist suitable algorithms for the detection of pairs of lead–lag clusters with high pairwise imbalance. Within our framework, we consider a number of choices for the pairwise lead–lag metric and directed network clustering model components. Our framework is validated on both a synthetic generative model for multivariate lead–lag time series systems and daily real-world US equity prices data. We showcase that our method is able to detect statistically significant lead–lag clusters in the US equity market. We study the nature of these clusters in the context of the empirical finance literature on lead–lag relations, and demonstrate how these can be used for the construction of predictive financial signals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clustering; Directed Networks; Financial Markets; Flow Imbalance; High-dimensional Time Series; Lead–lag; Unsupervised Learning; Chemical Detection; Commerce; Electronic Trading; Financial Markets; Real Time Systems; Unsupervised Learning; Clusterings; Directed Network; Flow Imbalances; High-dimensional; High-dimensional Time Series; Higher-dimensional; Lead-lag; Multivariate Time Series; Network Clustering; Times Series; Time Series","Chemical detection; Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Real time systems; Unsupervised learning; Clusterings; Directed network; Flow imbalances; High-dimensional; High-dimensional time series; Higher-dimensional; Lead-lag; Multivariate time series; Network Clustering; Times series; Time series","","","SB is supported by the EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning (EP/S023151/1) and The Alan Turing Institute\u2019s Finance and Economics Programme.

As the most developed country in the World, any policy adaptation of implementation in the US could influence the policies of other countries and regions. However, several factors could affect the country's economic performance, yet unexplored empirically, but are important from policy perspectives, which motivates this study. Therefore, the current study investigates the US's environmental laws, natural resource volatility, and economic performance from 1990 to 2020. The study used a novel wavelet methodology that considers wavelet power spectrum and wavelet coherence and provides short- and long-run estimates. The empirical results of the wavelet power spectrum reveal that environmental policy stringency and natural resource rents (total natural resource rents, natural gas rents, oil rents) are vulnerable in the selected time period. Additionally, the wavelet coherence empirically reports that there is a bidirectional causal association between environmental policy stringency, total natural resource rents, oil rents, and economic performance. In the short-run, the causality has been observed from these variables to economic performance, while from economic performance to these variables in the long run. Moreover, a unidirectional causal association runs from economic performance to natural gas rents. This study recommends strengthening environmental policy stringency and natural resources hedging to encourage economic performance and environmental sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Performance; Environmental Law; Natural Resources Volatility; Economic Analysis; Environmental Regulations; Power Spectrum; Sustainable Development; Economic Costs; Economic Performance; Environmental Law; Environmental Policy; Natural Resource Volatility; Resource Rents; Transmission Mechanisms; Volatility Transmissions; Wavelet Coherences; Wavelet Power Spectra; Natural Gas","Economic analysis; Environmental regulations; Power spectrum; Sustainable development; Economic costs; Economic performance; Environmental law; Environmental policy; Natural resource volatility; Resource rents; Transmission mechanisms; Volatility transmissions; Wavelet coherences; Wavelet power spectra; Natural gas","","","","Journal of Contemporary Issues and Thought, (2021); Aguiar-Conraria, Luís, Using wavelets to decompose the time-frequency effects of monetary policy, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 387, 12, pp. 2863-2878, (2008); Ahmad, Mahmood, The dynamic impact of natural resources, technological innovations and economic growth on ecological footprint: An advanced panel data estimation, Resources Policy, 69, (2020); Ahmed, Khalid, A predictive analysis of CO2 emissions, environmental policy stringency, and economic growth in China, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 25, 16, pp. 16091-16100, (2018); Akinsola, Motunrayo O., Asymmetric effect of oil price on economic growth: Panel analysis of low-income oil-importing countries, Energy Reports, 6, pp. 1057-1066, (2020); Atil, Ahmed, Are natural resources a blessing or a curse for financial development in Pakistan?

The findings show that the association between the food prices and indices with oil prices is bidirectional. Also, results show that the oil prices, demand, and supply shocks are the main contributors to volatility transmission compared to food prices and their sub-indices.

Our analysis is based on a novel dataset of stock transactions and bank loans of all publicly listed firms on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, covering January 2008 to June 2013. We find that firms with outstanding loans have a lower level of information asymmetry in the stock market, whereas firms with defaulted loans have a higher level of asymmetry. Further evidence demonstrates that the effect of loan default on information asymmetry in the stock market is more pronounced when these loans are borrowed from joint-equity commercial banks or multiple banks and when the default occurs under inactive market conditions.

However, understanding how to leverage large amounts of textual data alongside financial market information is important for the investors’ behavior analysis. In this study, we review over 150 publications in the field of behavioral finance that jointly investigated natural language processing (NLP) approaches and a market data analysis for financial decision support.

The results indicate that, for the levels of macroeconomic variables, economic growth, inflation and total export–import volume have significant negative impacts on oil fluctuations. However, exchange rate has a significant positive impact on oil volatility. And short-run interest rate does not have a significant effect on oil price volatility in most cases. In addition, the responses of oil price volatility to all five macroeconomic fluctuations are significant. More interestingly, the volatilities of economic growth and total import and export reduce oil price fluctuations during the pre-2004 period, but they increase oil price fluctuations during the post-2004 period. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodity Financialization; Garch-midas; Macroeconomic Variables; Mixing Frequency; Oil Price Fluctuations; Financial Market; Frequency Analysis; Inflation; Macroeconomics; Oil Production; Price Dynamics","financial market; frequency analysis; inflation; macroeconomics; oil production; price dynamics","","","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71701176, 72071166, 71974208) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2072019029).","Ahmed, Khalid, Decomposing the links between oil price shocks and macroeconomic indicators: Evidence from SAARC region, Resources Policy, 61, pp. 423-432, (2019); Akram, Qaisar Farooq, Commodity prices, interest rates and the dollar, Energy Economics, 31, 6, pp. 838-851, (2009); Amendola, Alessandra, On the influence of US monetary policy on crude oil price volatility, Empirical Economics, 52, 1, pp. 155-178, (2017); Asgharian, Hossein, The importance of the macroeconomic variables in forecasting stock return variance: A GARCH-MIDAS approach, Journal of Forecasting, 32, 7, pp. 600-612, (2013); OPEC Review, (2005); Beckmann, Joscha, Oil prices and effective dollar exchange rates, International Review of Economics and Finance, 27, pp. 621-636, (2013); Quantitative Finance and Economics, (2019); Bjørnland, Hilde Christiane, Oil and macroeconomic (in)stability, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 10, 4, pp. 128-151, (2018); Chang, Youngho, Oil price fluctuations and Singapore economy, Energy Policy, 31, 11, pp. 1151-1165, (2003); Chen, Xian, Oil shocks, competition, and corporate investment: Evidence from China, Energy Economics, 89, (2020)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10991158; 10769307","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097889102"

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a panel regression model was used to test the research hypotheses. The sample consists of 4,760 seasonality data and 119 Islamic mutual funds over ten-year period between 2011 and 2020. The dependent variable of the study is the cash flow of Islamic mutual funds and the independent variable of monetary policies includes the money growth rate, the liquidity growth rate, interest rate and inflation rate. Findings: Based on the results of the hypothesis test, all research variables including money growth rate, liquidity growth rate, interest rate and inflation rate have a negative and significant impact on Islamic mutual fund flows. These findings are consistent with the efficient market hypothesis and signaling theory. Research limitations/implications: This study has implication for policymakers, regulators and fund managers. The results show that the negative impact of monetary policies on Islamic mutual fund flows has a direct effect on the allocation decisions and investment strategies of Islamic mutual fund investors and managers. Also, the results of the research can reduce policymakers’ concerns about monetary policies and provide them forward-looking guidance policy. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to empirically examine the impact of monetary policies on Islamic mutual fund flows in an emerging economy and provides a significant contribution to the literature of mutual funds. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficient Market Hypothesis (emh); Islamic Mutual Fund Flows; Monetary Policies; Signaling Theory","","","","","Abdelsalam, Omneya H., On the comparative performance of socially responsible and Islamic mutual funds, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 103, pp. S108-S128, (2014); Alaabed, Alaa, Size, correlations, and diversification: New evidence from an application of wavelet approach to the emerging Islamic mutual fund industry, Borsa Istanbul Review, 19, pp. S14-S20, (2019); International Journal of Research in Engineering Science and Management, (2019); Andersson, Magnus, Why does the correlation between stock and bond returns vary over time?, Applied Financial Economics, 18, 2, pp. 139-151, (2008); Downside Risk and Mutual Fund Flows, (2019); Aslanidis, Nektarios, Quantiles of the realized stock-bond correlation and links to the macroeconomy, Journal of Empirical Finance, 28, pp. 321-331, (2014); Aslanidis, Nektarios, Predicting bond betas using macro-finance variables, Finance Research Letters, 29, pp. 193-199, (2019); Baele, Lieven, The determinants of stock and bond return comovements, Review of Financial Studies, 23, 6, pp. 2374-2428, (2010); Mutual Fund Flows Monetary Policy and Financial Stability, (2016); Banegas, Ayelen, The effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks on mutual fund investing, Journal of International Money and Finance, 123, (2022)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17590825; 17590817","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131511859"

However, voters are unable to distinguish between outcomes resulting from economic policies and those caused by exogenous external factors. Estimation results from seven Fractional Cointegrated VAR (FCVAR) models suggest that presidential approval increases with the monetary policy interest rate, the terms of trade, and manufacturing employment; and decreases with the nominal PEN/USD exchange rate and inflation volatility. Additionally, a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) conducted over a large set of macroeconomic indicators points to a greater influence of external over domestic factors in explaining presidential approval; i.e., economic outcomes that determine the dynamics of presidential approval are not under presidential control in Peru. It can be argued that these findings identify a significant source of political instability and a considerable challenge to democratic governance.

We perform wavelet-based time–frequency techniques and measure the market volatility with continuous wavelet transforms. Besides, we use wavelet coherency to understand the co-movement of economic activities and energy markets and employ a nonlinear phase-difference technique to understand the time-varying causality between different series. Our continuous wavelet transform results show that all three market indices experience significant volatility in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) period, notably during the initial period of the outbreak. The market volatilities are comparatively more substantial in the lower frequency band than the upper frequency, while the latter sustained longer in the markets. Moreover, wavelet coherency results show a strong correlation between the economic activity index and both energy market indices; however, the co-movement is significantly higher for the conventional energy market than the clean energy market. We further detect a positive and bi-directional causality between economic activities and energy market indices. Besides providing fresh and time-varying and frequency-varying relationship between global economic activities and the energy markets, which is currently lacking in the existing literature, our study has significant implications for the heterogeneous market participants in terms of improved price prediction accuracy. Furthermore, our findings can aid policymakers in decision making by showing that the dynamics between energy markets and economic activities change even within a short period, and imply that suitable constant policy interventions are necessary to avoid long-term predicament. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clean Energy; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Economic Activity; Energy Markets; Pandemic; Time–frequency Analysis; Wavelet Analysis; Decision Making; Energy Policy; Wavelet Transforms; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Economic Activities; Frequency Analysis; Frequency Techniques; Global Economic Activity; Heterogeneous Markets; Policy Intervention; Strong Correlation; Power Markets; Comparative Study; Covid-19; Disease Spread; Energy Management; Energy Market; Frequency Analysis; Pandemic","Decision making; Energy policy; Wavelet transforms; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Economic activities; Frequency Analysis; Frequency techniques; Global economic activity; Heterogeneous markets; Policy intervention; Strong correlation; Power markets; comparative study; COVID-19; disease spread; energy management; energy market; frequency analysis; pandemic","","","","undefined, (2020); Economics in the Time of Covid 19, (2020); Connolly, Richard, It’s déjà vu all over again: COVID-19, the global energy market, and the Russian economy, Eurasian Geography and Economics, 61, 4-5, pp. 511-531, (2020); Mitigating the Covid Economic Crisis Act Fast and do Whatever, (2020); undefined, (2020); Ramelli, Stefano, Feverish stock price reactions to COVID-19, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, 9, 3, pp. 622-655, (2020); undefined, (2020); Salisu, Afees Adebare, Uncertainty Due to Infectious Diseases and Energy Market Volatility, Energy Research Letters, 1, 2, (2020); Shaikh, Imlak, Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the energy markets, Economic Change and Restructuring, 55, 1, pp. 433-484, (2022); undefined, (2020)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","0958305X; 20484070","","EENVE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113546311"

However, correlation fully describes interdependence only if the financial system behaves linearly and if an assumption of multivariate normal distribution additionally holds true. At the same time, with intrinsic z score normalization, correlation ignores means (expected return) and variances (risk) when calibrating the interdependence. Such oversight raises the significant question of whether security return networks can be realistically modelled and interpreted by market correlations. This paper proposes the Euclidean (dis)similarity metric which enables incorporation of risk and return along with the primary correlation component. We apply this metric to explain the collective behavior of the MSCI world market and compare the results with other correlation networks. Findings show that realized volatility accounts for 71% of the observed topology whereas correlation explains only 29% of market structure. No evidence was found supporting the importance of expected return. Power law exponents and degree distributions reveal that the centrality of hub nodes are considerably higher in the Euclidean as opposed to correlation networks. Accordingly, the importance and influence of central countries (like US and Japan hubs) in the spreading of high volatility is considerably higher than what correlation networks report. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the funded body, the University of Tasmania, and the affiliated PhD supervision members: Prof. Mardi Dungey, Dr. Nagaratnam Jeyasreedharan and Dr. Vladimir Volkov.

Firstly, this paper employs the TVP-VAR model to analyze the time-varying impacts of oil price volatility on the panic index using monthly data from January 1990 to November 2021. Then, after using the SVAR model to decompose the oil price volatility, this paper uses the PDL model to analyze the heterogeneous impacts of oil price volatility from different sources. Finally, based on the results of oil decomposition, this paper uses the TARCH model to analyze the asymmetric impacts of oil price volatility in different directions. The results show that: (1) oil price volatility can indeed cause market panic, and these impacts exhibit time-varying characteristics; (2) oil price volatility from different sources has different impacts on the panic index, and the order from high to low is oil-specific demand shocks, supply shocks, and aggregate demand shocks; and (3) oil price volatility has asymmetric impacts on the panic index, and positive shocks have greater impacts than negative. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Market Panic; Oil Price Volatility; Vix Index; Demand Shocks; Empirical Test; Market Panic; Oil Price Volatility; Svar Models; Tarch Model; Time Varying; Time-varying Characteristics; Var Models; Vix Index","Demand shocks; Empirical test; Market panic; Oil price volatility; SVAR models; TARCH model; Time varying; Time-varying characteristics; VAR models; VIX index","","","Funding: This research was funded by the Excellent Youth Project of Hunan Education Department in China, grant number 21B0804.","Moghaddam, Mohsen Bakhshi, Heterogeneous effects of oil price fluctuations: Evidence from a nonparametric panel data model in Canada, Energy Economics, 110, (2022); Liu, Yadong, The relationship among oil prices volatility, inflation rate, and sustainable economic growth: Evidence from top oil importer and exporter countries, Resources Policy, 77, (2022); Huang, Jianbai, Do oil prices and economic policy uncertainty matter for precious metal returns?

The asymmetry of credit rating changes between the high and low credit-rated firms appears to be significantly different. While high credit-rated firms’ upgrade probabilities do not differ in expansions and contractions, low credit-rated firms’ upgrade probabilities are significantly asymmetric in expansions and contractions. Furthermore, the probabilities of downgrade appear to be asymmetric in expansions and contractions for most of the credit rating levels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Variables; Corporate Bond Rating; Credit Risk; Macroeconomic Indicators; Markov Regime-switching","","","","This research was partially supported by theRowe Research Foundation at the Faculty of Management, Dalhousie University.

The aim of this paper is to quantify the impacts of infectious disease pandemic on the long-term volatility and correlation of gold and crude oil markets by using the DCC-MIDAS approach. The empirical results show that infectious disease pandemic does has prominent positive impacts on the long-run volatilities of both gold and crude oil markets, and these impacts are strengthened with the time lags of infectious disease pandemic. Furthermore, crude oil market is more vulnerable to public health emergencies than gold market. Finally, infectious disease pandemic also has significantly positive effects on the long-term correlation between gold and crude oil markets.

Design/Methodology/Approach: In the estimation, the ARDL bounds test approach was employed to examine the existence of co-integration and the relationship of long-run and short-run between the new infection rates and stock price volatility, as stable and unstable variables are mixed. The inner-day and inter-day volatility, based on the Shanghai (securities) composite index, are estimated in separate empirical models. In addition, the Inter-bank overnight lending rate (IBOLR) is controlled in order to consider the effect of liquidity and investment cost. Findings and Implications: We find that in the initial year (2020) of the epidemic, the new infection rate is negatively correlated to stock prices in the short-term, whereas no significant evidence existed in the long-term, regardless of model specifications. However, after the epidemic's outbreak (2021), the result depicts that new infections increased stock prices in the long-term, and depressed its inner-day volatility in the short-term, which is inconsistent with most investigations. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that investors were more concerned about the withdrawal of monetary easing and fiscal stimulus, which were introduced to fight against the epidemic's impact on economy, than the epidemic itself. This study complements the limitations of most existing studies, which just focus on the period of the epidemic's outbreak, and provides insight into macroeconomic policy making in the era of the post COVID-19 epidemic such as the structural and ordered exit of the stimulating policies, intervention in IBOLR and balance social and economic sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ardl Bounds Test; Covid-19; Ibolr; Policy Withdraw; Stock Volatility; China; Epidemiology; Human; Investment; Pandemic; Policy; Covid-19; Humans; Investments; Pandemics; Policy","China; epidemiology; human; investment; pandemic; policy; COVID-19; Humans; Investments; Pandemics; Policy","","","The authors thanks the financial support of Philosophy & Social Science Fund of Shaoxing City, China (145138).","Zhang, Tingting, Lottery preference and stock market return: Chinese evidence using daily and provincial data, Applied Economics Letters, 28, 18, pp. 1582-1588, (2021); Bai, Lan, Infectious disease pandemic and permanent volatility of international stock markets: A long-term perspective, Finance Research Letters, 40, (2021); Rahman, Md Lutfur, The COVID-19 outbreak and stock market reactions: Evidence from Australia, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Shakouri, Rita, Stochastic p-robust DEA efficiency scores approach to banking sector, Journal of Modelling in Management, 15, 3, pp. 893-917, (2020); Iqbal, Najaf, Asymmetric nexus between COVID-19 outbreak in the world and cryptocurrency market, International Review of Financial Analysis, 73, (2021); Finance Forum, (2021); Susskind, Daniel, The economics of the COVID-19 pandemic: An assessment, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 36, pp. S1-S13, (2020); Johansen, Søren, Statistical analysis of cointegration vectors, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 12, 2-3, pp. 231-254, (1988); Johansen, Søren, MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE ON COINTEGRATION — WITH APPLICATIONS TO THE DEMAND FOR MONEY, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 52, 2, pp. 169-210, (1990); Econometrics Journal, (2004)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","22962565","","","35664100","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131341728"

Business trust is important for entrepreneurs because it significantly determines the decision-making process and ensures stable development and functioning of an organization. Our study assessed the G7 and the E27 countries and Poland for comparison purposes for the years 2015–2021.

The presented research results indicate that there is a relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of economic indicators and BCI. This is particularly noticeable during the development of the pandemic at the turn of the first and second quarters of 2020. The indicator shows negative values during this period.

We observe a clear distinction of the nature of the underlying time series dynamics by applying a novel and combinatory chaos analysis framework by comparing the wavelet-filtered S&P 500 returns with surrogate datasets, Brownian motion returns, and a Lorenz system realisation. Furthermore, we are the first to observe the strange attractor of the daily S&P 500 return system graphically via Takens’ embedding and a spectral embedding in combination with Laplacian eigenmaps.

The study closes several gaps found in the literature related to the choice of explanatory variables and the formation of a data sample for modeling. The task to be solved is highly relevant. There is a growing need for high-precision and low-cost models for reproducing the credit ratings of machine-building companies (internal credit ratings). This is due to the ongoing growth of credit risks of companies in the industry, as well as the limited number of assigned public ratings to these companies from international rating agencies due to the high cost of the rating pro-cess. The study compares the predictive power of three machine learning models: ordered logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. The sample of companies includes 109 machine-building enterprises from 18 countries between 2005 and 2016. The financial indicators of companies that correspond to Moody’s industry methodology and the macroeconomic indicators of the companies’ home countries are used as explanatory variables. The results show that artificial intelligence models have the greatest predictive ability among the models studied. The random forest model demonstrated a prediction accuracy of 50%, the gradient boosting model-47%. Their predictive power is almost twice as high as the accuracy of ordered logistic regression (25%). In addition, the article tested two different ways of forming a sample: the random method and one that accounts for the time factor. The result showed that the use of random sampling increases the predictive power of the models. The incorporation of macroeconomic variables into the models does not improve their predictive power. The explanation is that rating agencies follow a “through the cycle” rating approach to ensure rating stability. The results of the study may be useful for researchers who are engaged in assessing the accuracy of empirical methods for modeling credit ratings, as well as banking industry practitioners who use such models directly to assess the creditworthiness of machine-building companies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Ratings; Internal Credit Ratings; Machine Learning Models; Machine-building Companies; Rating Agencies","","","","The paper was written as a part of the work performed by the Group on Research of the School of Finance of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of HSE Banking Sector Innovations, its Financial Soundness and Prudential Regulation.

We empirically test the widely used Markovian property and time homogeneity assumptions at an unprecedented scale. Our unique data set consists of internal probability of default estimates from 12 global banks that employ an advanced internal ratings-based approach, covering monthly observations on 20 000 corporates over the period 2015–18. The results indicate that internal credit risk estimates do not satisfy the two assumptions, showing evidence of both path dependency and time heterogeneity even within the period of economic expansion. Banks tend to revert their rating actions, which contradicts previous findings based on data from credit rating agencies. This has significant practical implications through bank-sourced credit transition matrixes, which are becoming increasingly important as regulators begin to use more detailed credit risk data sets (eg, analytical credit data sets by the European Central Bank) with potential applications in stress testing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Credit Risk; Probability Of Default; Risk Management; Transition Matrixes","","","","I thank David Carruthers and Thomas Aubrey for comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

The paper seeks to conduct the investigation at individual MEI level rather than the composite MEI. Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative approach was used in this paper. Monthly data span of 1996–2018 was used. The delay and half-life technique was used to determine the speed with which the information resulting from the changes in the macroeconomic are evident in the stock price. Thereafter, Toda–Yamamoto Granger no-causality approach was used to examine the causal relationship amongst variables. Findings: The paper revealed that although the market adjustment to MEI has improved, the speed is till slow. The exchange rate exhibited the slowest speed in respect of the market reaction while the market reaction to money supply was the fastest. Toda–Yamamoto Granger no-causality estimation also revealed a bi-directional causality between MEI (gross domestic product, interest rate and money supply) and stock price and uni-directional relationship flowing from MEI (the exchange rate and foreign direct investment) to stock price. The paper also found no causality between inflation and stock price. Research limitations/implications: The findings although revealed improved level of market efficiency in comparison with the earlier data, the speed of adjustment is still undesirable. Rigorous approach should be adopted for the implementation of major reforms such as alternative market so as to increase the number of share listing and to increase the scope of investors' participation to enhancing trading volume and marketability and ultimately speed up information diffusion. Practical implications: The practical implication of the low level of information processing rate of Ghana Stock Exchange (averagely more than a month) is that astute investors and market analysts could employ MEI to outperform the market prior to their infusion onto the stock market. Originality/value: This study is one of the few studies in the Ghanaian literature that has extended the investigation of the speed of adjustment beyond composite or aggregate macroeconomic level estimation to estimation at individual variable level. This contribution is very relevant since each macroeconomic variable has unique characteristics and require specific policy framework, it is important to consider the speed of adjustment from the perspective of each of the individual variables. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Delay; Half-life Technique; Macroeconomic Information; Speed Of Adjustment; Stock Market Condition; Stock Prices; Toda–yamamoto Granger No-causality Approach","","","","","Macroeconomic Factors and Stock Market Movement Evidence from Ghana, (2008); International Business and Management, (2010); African Journal of Accounting Economics Finance and Banking Research, (2008); Adom, Philip Kofi, Electricity Consumption-Economic growth nexus: The Ghanaian case, International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy, 1, 1, pp. 18-31, (2011); Journal of Islamic Economics Banking and Finance, (2008); Accounting and Finance Research, (2012); European Scientific Journal, (2013); Fully Modified Ols Fmols and Ols, (2016); African Journal of Business Management, (2012); Int J Manag Econ Soc Sci, (2013)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","17468817; 17468809","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091744124"

Also, it aims to investigate the impact of the structure of board directors, macroeconomic variables and banking specific factors on banking diversification. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use generalized least squares regressions to examine the impact of banking specific, macroeconomic and governance variables on investment diversification of 66 Islamic and conventional banks during the period from 2006 to 2018. In addition, this study uses panel threshold regressions to study the impact of banks’ profitability and risks on investment diversification in different financial stress levels. Findings: The findings show liquidity risk, performance, credit risk and capitalization ratio are significantly related to investment diversification of Islamic banks. On the other hand, liquidity and credit risks, capital to total assets ratio and size have a significant influence on investment diversification of conventional banks. In addition, the diversification strategy of Islamic banks is less sensitive to macroeconomic indicators. As regards to governance variables, the results suggest that the board size, the executive directors and the foreign directors have significant impact on the investment diversification in Islamic banks. On the other hand, chief executive officer duality and foreign directors affect significantly the investment diversification of conventional banks. This study also found that financial stress enables us to develop a better understanding of the relation “performance-risks and diversification.” Practical implications: It is expected that the findings of this paper can be used by Islamic and conventional banks in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region that seek to manage the diversification strategy by reducing risk-taking and maximizing profitability. This study suggests that bank managers should consider the level of financial stress during the development of diversification strategy. It provides a better understanding for bank managers about the effect of bank specific and macroeconomics factors as well as governance variables on diversification. Originality/value: This study focuses on providing an extension of the existing literature by studying the impact of financial stress indices on the relation between banks’ risk-performance and investment diversification for Islamic and conventional banks in the GCC region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Profitability; Diversification; Financial Risks; Financial Stress; Islamic Banks","","","","","Alandejani, Maha, Nonperforming loans in the GCC banking sectors: Does the Islamic finance matter?, Research in International Business and Finance, 42, pp. 832-854, (2017); Alandejani, Maha, Do Islamic banks fail more than conventional banks?, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 50, pp. 135-155, (2017); Journal of Management Research, (2013); Amidu, Mohammed, Does bank competition and diversification lead to greater stability?

For this reason, it is crucial to know the effect levels of the factors that affect stock prices. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the psychological behavior of investors also affects stock prices. Therefore, the study aims to reveal the different sensitivity levels of the stock index against macroeconomic and psychological factors. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study, dollar rate (USD), euro rate (EURO), time deposit interest rate (IR), gold price (GOLD), industrial production index (IPI), and consumer price index (CPI) (inflation (INF)) were used as macroeconomic factors, while Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and VIX Fear Index (VIX) were used as psychological factors. In addition, the BIST-100 index, which is listed in Borsa Istanbul, was used as the stock index. The sensitivity of the stock index to macroeconomic and psychological factors was investigated using the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) method using data from January 2012 to October 2020. Findings: In the analyses performed using the MARS method, the coefficients of INF, USD, EURO, IR, CCI, and VIX Index were found to be statistically significant and effective on the stock index. Among these variables, INF has the highest effect on stocks. It is followed by USD, IR, EURO, CCI, and VIX. GOLD and IPI variables did not show statistical significance in the model. The most important difference of the MARS model from other regressions is that each factor’s effect on the stock index is analyzed by separating it according to the value of the factor. According to the results obtained from the MARS model: (1) it has been determined that USD, EURO, IR, and CPI have both positive and negative effects on the stock market index and (2) CCI and VIX have been found to have negative effects on stocks. These results provide essential information about how investors who plan to invest in the stock index should take into consideration different macroeconomic and psychological values. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature as it is one of the first studies to examine the effects of factors affecting the stock index by decomposing it according to the values it takes. Also, this study provides additional information by listing the factors affecting the stock index in order of importance. These results will help investors, portfolio managers, company executives, and policy-makers understand the stock markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Markets; Macroeconomic Factors; Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline; Psychological Factors; Stock Markets; Vix Fear Index","","","","","African Journal of Business Management, (2009); Hitit Universitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitusu Dergisi, (2019); International Journal Social Science Research, (2013); International Journal of Economic and Social Research, (2012); Ayyıldız, Ezgi, Loop-based conic multivariate adaptive regression splines is a novel method for advanced construction of complex biological networks, European Journal of Operational Research, 270, 3, pp. 852-861, (2018); Baker, Malcolm P., Investor sentiment in the stock market, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, 2, pp. 129-151, (2007); Journal of Economics and Administrative Sciences University of Ataturk, (2011); Journal of Asset Management, (2006); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2016); Dokuz Eylul Universitesi Sletme Fakultesi Dergisi, (2018)","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","9781801171397; 9781801171403","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173212146"

It presents the story on the back of dual intertwined cornerstone pillars: The initial agenda sets the global macroeconomic context and its interplay with financial markets and sub-segment capital markets. Then the book moves to the evolvement of the inherent capital markets, from nascence to present day, and through profiling of the current operating surroundings. The latter pillar performs empirical research built upon Eugene Fama’s weak form efficiency theorem with statistical testing results further framing the comprehensive findings on five selected southeast European developing capital markets. Jointly the two parts present the first such well-documented capital markets set up complemented by wide-ranging empirical findings of inefficiency. The book introduces at first the global perspective, in which the growing globalization in the past decades has led to improved efficiencies, to faster innovation, and to greater systemic connectedness and meaningfully so by an increasing contribution from transitioning economies. Nevertheless, in higher systemic concentration there is an implied higher volatility risk and evidence has revealed dichotomous reaction through divergence in impact between the developed and the developing economies. The capital markets industry is at the forefront of financial innovation and many aspects in its function and power are a determining factor in wider socio-economic progress. The findings uncover details of market structure and role and with that this work creates significant new knowledge on the industry, and will be of particular interest to investors, taxpayers, academics, researchers, and policy makers of capital markets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Market Failures; Capital Market Economy; Capital Markets; Efficient Capital Markets; Frontier And Emerging Markets; Innovation With Financial Products; Southeast Europe","","","","","Barbić, Tajana, Relationship between macroeconomic fundamentals and stock market indices in selected CEE countries, Ekonomski Pregled, 62, 3-4, pp. 113-133, (2011); Annual Report, (2012); Dumas, Bernard, Are correlations of stock returns justified by subsequent changes in national outputs?, Journal of International Money and Finance, 22, 6, pp. 777-811, (2003); Errunza, Vihang R., Macroeconomic determinants of european stock market volatility, European Financial Management, 4, 3, pp. 361-377, (1998); Eurostat Databased, (2018); American Economic Review, (1981); Fama, Eugene F., Stock Returns, Expected Returns, and Real Activity, Journal of Finance, 45, 4, pp. 1089-1108, (1990); Journal of Finance, (1970); World Economic and Financials Surveys, (2017); Long Run Relationships Between Stock Market Returns and Macroeconomic Performance Evidence from Turkey, (2003)","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","9783031072109; 9783031072093","","","English","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161514378"

However, the observed sentiment time-series represent a noisy proxy of the true investor sentiment. Moreover, modeling the joint dynamics of different sentiment series can be beneficial for the assessment of their economic relevance. The main methodological contribution of this paper is twofold: (i) we filter the latent sentiment signals in a genuinely multivariate model; (ii) we propose a decomposition into a long-term random walk component, named long-term sentiment, and a short-term component driven by a stationary Vector Autoregressive process of order one, named short-term sentiment. The proposed framework is a dynamic factor model describing the joint evolution of the observed sentiments of a portfolio of assets. Empirically, we find that the long-term sentiment co-integrates with the market price factor, while the short-term sentiment captures transient and firm-specific swings. By means of quantile regressions, we assess the significance of the explanatory power of filtered present sentiment on future returns. Then, we demonstrate how the lagged relation can be successfully exploited in a portfolio allocation exercise. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Expectation Maximization; Investment Analysis; Kalman-filter; Quantile Regressions; Sentiment Analysis","","","","Fabrizio Lillo acknowledges support by the SOBIGDATA+ + project funded by the H2020 Research Infrastructure (European Commission) research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 871042.

The individual systemic risk measurement has a certain scope of application and application conditions and, therefore, it is difficult for the individual indicator to reflect the systemic risk comprehensively. In this paper, the systemic risk is divided into four types: institution-specific risk, comovement and contagion, financial vulnerability, liquidity and credit. Next, the optimal combination is selected from multiple individual systemic risk indicators through dominance analysis to forecast the macroeconomic performance. The macroeconomic performance selects consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI), industrial growth value (IVA), growth rate of broad money supply (M2) and gross domestic product (GDP) as proxies to compare the forecast effect of systemic risk, with the period considered spans from 2003M4 to 2022M7. The results of immediate forecasts of different macroeconomic performance proxies demonstrate the individual indicator cannot cover all the information of systemic risk, can only reflect the specific aspect of macroeconomic performance, or is only highly relevant in a given period. The contribution of systemic risk to the forecast of different macroeconomic performance proxies in different terms is diverse, and show various types of results.

We find a significant time-varying impact of inflation rate, interest rates, and exchange rates on stock returns, suggesting that the impacts of these variables on stock returns change over time. The findings also confirm the time-varying volatility impacts, indicating that the intensity and magnitude of the transmission of macroeconomic volatility to stock returns’ volatility significantly changes over time.

Furthermore, the study also analyses the variation in results due to the occurrence of uncertain events. For the empirical analysis, non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) techniques have been employed, and the findings substantiate an asymmetric relationship between the US EPU and the Indian stock market, while a symmetric relationship between the Chinese EPU and the Indian stock market. The study also reveals that in the short run, the Indian stock market is immune to the fluctuations in the Chinese stock market and policy uncertainty. Moreover, the outcomes further reveal that the US and Indian stock markets project a mirror performance. In addition, the study further reveals that, unlike the pre-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) timeline, during the COVID-19, the short-run volatility was high between the explanatory and outcome variables.

Moreover, we find negative significant flow of information between the variables, in that knowing the history of one variable (either stock or macroeconomic variable), in this case, indicates considerably more uncertainty than knowing the history of only the other variable (either stock or macroeconomic variable). We also observe that global economic policy uncertainty has the most significant adverse causal relationship with stock returns of BRICS, especially in the long term.

Electricity generator companies need to have a short-term forecast one hour ahead to predict capacity utilization. However, most of the causal factors have a lower frequency of measurement, for example, macroeconomic indicators. As a result, there are problems of combining data of different frequencies. We propose a prediction model that combines convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The input block of the network takes data of different frequencies as one pattern. The reduction of data to one frequency occurs endogenously in the model using convolutional blocks. We assume that this makes it possible to remove noise and reveal the spatial correlation between factors better than in the case of linear interpolation. The recurrent block is used to extract useful prediction information from the temporal data structure. The results of testing the model demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison with benchmarks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forecasting; Multifrequency Data; Neural Networks; Time Series; Wholesale Electricity Market; Convolution; Electric Industry; Electric Power Generation; Power Markets; Recurrent Neural Networks; Different Frequency; Electricity Demand Forecasting; Electricity Sector; Explanatory Variables; Frequency Data; Market Forecasting; Multifrequency Data; Neural-networks; Times Series; Wholesale Electricity Markets; Forecasting","Convolution; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Power markets; Recurrent neural networks; Different frequency; Electricity demand forecasting; Electricity sector; Explanatory variables; Frequency data; Market forecasting; Multifrequency data; Neural-networks; Times series; Wholesale electricity markets; Forecasting","","","","Kim, Taeyoung, Predicting residential energy consumption using CNN-LSTM neural networks, Energy, 182, pp. 72-81, (2019); Kuo, Ping Huan, A high precision artificial neural networks model for short-Term energy load forecasting, Energies, 11, 1, (2018); Chen, Yongbao, Short-term electrical load forecasting using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to calculate the demand response baseline for office buildings, Applied Energy, 195, pp. 659-670, (2017); Do, Linh Phuong Catherine, Electricity consumption modelling: A case of Germany, Economic Modelling, 55, pp. 92-101, (2016); Kuzin, Vladimir, MIDAS vs. mixed-frequency VAR: Nowcasting GDP in the euro area, International Journal of Forecasting, 27, 2, pp. 529-542, (2011); Pan, Zhiyuan, Oil price volatility and macroeconomic fundamentals: A regime switching GARCH-MIDAS model, Journal of Empirical Finance, 43, pp. 130-142, (2017); Oxford Handbook of Economic Forecasting, (2011)","Shaposhnikov, S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","3rd International Conference on Neural Networks and Neurotechnologies, NeuroNT 2022","","St. Petersburg","180515","","9781665467766","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134303013"

This has raised debates on whether and how it affects the competitiveness of commercial banks. Nevertheless, empirical evidence remains sparse and inclusive, especially for SSA countries. It is on this premise that this study, therefore, investigates competition in commercial banks before and after recapitalization for six selected SSA countries. The study employs the Panzar-Rosse model to analyze bank-level and macroeconomic indicators between 2000 and 2015. The results show that the H-statistic increased from –0.15, –0.28 and -0.82 before capitalization to 0.94, 0.97 and 0.7 after recapitalization for the first, second and third estimations respectively. This showed that bank competition is higher for the period after recapitalization than the period before recapitalization. The study, therefore, concludes that bank recapitalization could be necessary, especially for countries with low minimum paid-up capital. It is to the extent that banks can now be self-reliant with a higher capacity to invest, as this will significantly improve competition in commercial banks’ services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Africa; Central Bank Recapitalization Policy; Competition; Panzar-rosse","","","","This research study was supported by a grant from the African Economic Research Consortium, Nairobi Kenya.

The challenge of Forex research lies in its characteristics, fluctuation, non-linearity, and random walk phenomena. Several related studies generate forecasting signals using fundamental data (FD) and technical indicator data (TI) to support Forex. FD is an indicator of country economic conditions, while TI shows the price pattern-based signal. However, these two indicators pose two major limitations on their deployment. First, modeling a sequential neural network causes gradient vanishing and information loss. Second, FD exerts a significant impact on currency price upon its quarterly update and release. The second limitation is known as FD releasing problem. Moreover, Forex forecasting using FD and TI is typically conducted in an equal aggregation manner, resulting in inaccurate prediction due to unequal data changing frequency. In this work, we propose a cascading model for forex market forecasting using FD and TI based on BERT (BERTFOREX). The processing step of BERTFOREX are as follows: 1) BERT is applied to FD for extracting the hidden patterns over the designated period. 2) These extracted hidden patterns of FD are aggregated as additional weights to TI since FD frequency changes slower than that of TI. 3) BERT is again applied to extract the aggregated pattern within TI and FD over other influencing days. 4) To demonstrate the efficiency of BERTFOREX, the aggregated pattern is fed into a simple neural network for forecasting. The proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of percentage of correct signals, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Deep Learning; Forex; Time Series Forecasting; Deep Learning; Economics; Finite Difference Method; Time Series; Bidirectional Encoder Representation From Transformer; Characteristic Fluctuations; Exchange Rate Forecasting; Foreign Exchange; Foreign Exchange Rates; Hidden Patterns; Market Forecasting; Technical Indicator; Time Series Forecasting; Forecasting","Deep learning; Economics; Finite difference method; Time series; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Characteristic fluctuations; Exchange rate forecasting; Foreign exchange; Foreign exchange rates; Hidden patterns; Market forecasting; Technical indicator; Time series forecasting; Forecasting","","","","Almeida, Álvaro Santos, The effects of macroeconomic news on high frequency exchange rate behavior, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 33, 3, pp. 383-408, (1998); Andersen, Torben G., Micro effects of macro announcements: Real-time price discovery in foreign exchange, American Economic Review, 93, 1, pp. 38-62, (2003); Chang, Yuanchen, Information arrivals and intraday exchange rate volatility, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 13, 2, pp. 85-112, (2003); Evans, Martin D.D., Do currency markets absorb news quickly?, Journal of International Money and Finance, 24, 2, pp. 197-217, (2005); Qi, Min, Nonlinear prediction of exchange rates with monetary fundamentals, Journal of Empirical Finance, 10, 5, pp. 623-640, (2003); Abuhamad, Mohammed, Event-driven business intelligence approach for real-time integration of technical and fundamental analysis in forex market, Journal of Computer Science, 9, 4, pp. 488-499, (2013); Yao, Jingtao, A case study on using neural networks to perform technical forecasting of forex, Neurocomputing, 34, pp. 79-98, (2000); Eng, Minghao, Forecast Forex With ANN using fundamental data, 1, pp. 279-282, (2008); Ling, Joseph Zhi Bin, Forecast foreign exchange with both linear and nonlinear models coupled with trading rules for selected currencies, pp. 1112-1118, (2015); Yıldırım, Deniz Can, Forecasting directional movement of Forex data using LSTM with technical and macroeconomic indicators, Financial Innovation, 7, 1, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124815085"

A research instrument consisting of 14 attributes was designed and sent to 2100 respondents. 467 responses were collected over a period of 6 months and KANO model was developed to classify the information into ‘must be’, ‘linear’, and ‘delight’ attributes. It was found that ‘must be’ attributes include condition of financial statements, current economic indicators, and the result of technical analysis and ‘insider information’ is a ‘delight’ attribute.

Even a minor gain in predicting performance will be extremely profitable and significant. Our novel study implemented six boosting techniques, i.e., XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting, and these boosting techniques were hybridised using a stacking framework to find out the direction of the stock market. Five different stock datasets were selected from four different countries and were used for our experiment. We used two-way overfitting protection during our model building process, i.e., dynamic reduction technique and cross-validation technique. For model evaluation purposes, we used the performance metrics, i.e., accuracy, ROC curve (AUC), F-score, precision, and recall. The aim of our study was to propose and select a predictive model whose training and testing accuracy difference was minimal in all stocks. The findings revealed that the meta-classifier Meta-LightGBM had training and testing accuracy differences that were very low among all stocks. As a result, a proper model selection might allow investors the freedom to invest in a certain stock in order to successfully control risk and create short-term, sustainable profits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catboost; Cross-validation; Ensemble; Hist Gradient Boosting; Lda; Securities Exchange; Stock Exchange; Stock Market","","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: Jana Shafi would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research, Prince Sattam bin Abdul Aziz University, for supporting this work.; Funding text 2: Funding: This research was supported by Sejong University Research fund.","Adam, Klaus, Stock Market Volatility and Learning, Journal of Finance, 71, 1, pp. 33-82, (2016); Kunze, Frederik, The usefulness of oil price forecasts—Evidence from survey predictions, Managerial and Decision Economics, 39, 4, pp. 427-446, (2018); Farida Agustini, W., Stock price prediction using geometric Brownian motion, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 974, 1, (2018); Dinh, Thuy An, An empirical study on importance of modeling parameters and trading volume-based features in daily stock trading using neural networks, Informatics, 5, 3, (2018); Mehdizadeh, Saeid, A Comparative Study of Autoregressive, Autoregressive Moving Average, Gene Expression Programming and Bayesian Networks for Estimating Monthly Streamflow, Water Resources Management, 32, 9, pp. 3001-3022, (2018); Zhang, Yujin, Fractional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Finite-Element Modal: The Forecast of Tire Vibration Trend, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 40137-40142, (2018); Li, Qingchen, Relationship research between meteorological disasters and stock markets based on a multifractal detrending moving average algorithm, International Journal of Modern Physics B, 32, 1, (2018); Petukhova, Tatiana, Assessment of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA), and random forest (RF) time series regression models for predicting influenza A virus frequency in swine in Ontario, Canada, PLOS ONE, 13, 6, (2018); Wang, Dabuxilatu, A fuzzy set-valued autoregressive moving average model and its applications, Symmetry, 10, 8, (2018); IEEE Systems Journal, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117747677"

We empirically investigate whether the findings of the literature obtained using an in-sample approach also hold in a real-time out-of-sample exercise. We demonstrate that the main econometric models lose accuracy in an out-of-sample application and cannot outperform a naive model. Additionally, we highlight that the main reason is the counterintuitive direction of a large number of small asset price movements around the release.

Design/methodology/approach: Monthly time-series dataset and the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) semi-parametric econometric technique are used to establish the effect of weather variables on stock market return. Findings: This study finds that temperature and wind speed have a negative and statistically significant relationship with stock market performance. Likewise, humidity exhibits a negative relationship with stock market performance, albeit insignificant. The relevant stock market and macroeconomic control variables are statistically significant in addition to exhibiting their expected signs. The findings lend support to advocates of behavioural factors inclusion in asset pricing and decision-making. Practical implications: For policy purposes, the authors recommend that traders, investors and stock exchange managers must take into consideration different weather conditions as they influence investors' behaviour, investment decisions, and consequently, the stock market performance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study provides the first empirical evidence of the nexus between disaggregated weather measures and stock market performance in Ghana.

Recent studies show that economic variables fail to predict stock volatility beyond lagged volatility. In this paper, we find that realized skewness shows significant predictive ability for future realized volatility. We use the daily price data of the S&P 500 index over a long sample period spanning 1928 to 2019 to construct skewness predictors, and reveal the negative relationship between realized skewness and volatility. The realized skewness significantly outperforms the benchmark of the autoregressive model in short horizons and contains different predictive information from macroeconomic indicators and volatility of volatility. The predictive ability of skewness is also found in most industry portfolios. The realized skewness predicts volatility mainly through risk transmission channel, and then through the business cycle channel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forecast Performance; Predictive Regression; Realized Skewness; Risk Transmission; Stock Volatility","","","","The authors are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for their insightful comments that help to improve the quality of this paper.

The framework will be of use for both investors and traders. In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, global financial markets have seen growing uncertainty and volatility and as a consequence, precise prediction of stock price trend has emerged to be extremely challenging. In this background, we propose two integrated frameworks wherein rigorous feature engineering, methodology to sort out class imbalance, and predictive modeling are clubbed together to perform stock trend prediction during normal and new normal times. A number of technical and macroeconomic indicators are chosen as explanatory variables, which are further refined through dedicated feature engineering process by applying Kernel Principal Component (KPCA) analysis. Bootstrapping procedure has been used to deal with class imbalance. Finally, two separate Artificial Intelligence models namely, Stacking and Deep Neural Network models are deployed separately on feature engineered and bootstrapped samples for estimating trends in prices of underlying stocks during pre and post Covid-19 periods. Rigorous performance analysis and comparative evaluation with other well-known models justify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed frameworks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Binary Classification; Bootstrapping; Deep Neural Network; Kernel Principal Component (kpca); Stacking; Commerce; Costs; Electronic Trading; Financial Markets; Forecasting; Investments; Neural Network Models; Principal Component Analysis; Binary Classification; Bootstrapping; Class Imbalance; Feature Engineerings; Kernel Principal Component; Paperstock; Performances Analysis; Stackings; Stock Trend Prediction; Deep Neural Networks","Commerce; Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Neural network models; Principal component analysis; Binary classification; Bootstrapping; Class imbalance; Feature engineerings; Kernel principal component; Paperstock; Performances analysis; Stackings; Stock trend prediction; Deep neural networks","","","","Ahmar, Ansari Saleh, SutteARIMA: Short-term forecasting method, a case: Covid-19 and stock market in Spain, Science of the Total Environment, 729, (2020); Atsalakis, George S., Forecasting stock market short-term trends using a neuro-fuzzy based methodology, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 7, pp. 10696-10707, (2009); Chindanur, Narendra Babu, Prediction of selected Indian stock using a partitioning–interpolation based ARIMA–GARCH model, Applied Computing and Informatics, 11, 2, pp. 130-143, (2015); Basu, S., INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF COMMON STOCKS IN RELATION TO THEIR PRICE‐EARNINGS RATIOS: A TEST OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS, Journal of Finance, 32, 3, pp. 663-682, (1977); Basu, Sanjoy, The relationship between earnings' yield, market value and return for NYSE common stocks.

Stock markets in the Eastern European countries are weak-form efficient which exposes them to speculative prices. This study investigates the influence of the macroeconomic and firm-specific factors on stock prices of the listed companies within the Visegrad Stock Markets. The study employs regression analyses based on a Pooled OLS and Fixed Effect models with year dummies and standard errors clustered at the country level, which are robust to autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. Data collection consists of 55 listed companies based on the weekly stock prices, from January 2013 till December 2018. The results indicate that total equity is the only significant element that influences the individual stock prices of the companies in the four established models. Additionally, increase in supply of shares declines the current stock prices and the other way around. However, the exchange rate and inflation level indicate a negative influence on the stock prices with weaker significance. The findings show that stock markets of the V4 countries are overall inefficient since important indicators, such as economic activity, debt level, cash flow, firm size, oil, and gold prices have limited influence on the stock price movements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Indicators; Fixed Effects; Macroeconomic Indicators; Pooled Ols; Stock Prices; Visegrad Countries","","","","This research was funded by the GCRF COMPASS Project.","Aliu, Florin, Interdependence and risk comparison of Slovak, Hungarian and Polish stock markets: Policy and managerial implications, Acta Oeconomica, 69, 2, pp. 273-287, (2019); Anari, Ali, Stock prices and inflation, Journal of Financial Research, 24, 4, pp. 587-602, (2001); Apergis, Nicholas, Interest rates, inflation, and stock prices: The case of the Athens Stock Exchange, Journal of Policy Modeling, 24, 3, pp. 231-236, (2002); Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen, Do exchange rate changes have symmetric or asymmetric effects on stock prices?, Global Finance Journal, 31, pp. 57-72, (2016); Bams, Dennis, Does oil and gold price uncertainty matter for the stock market?, Journal of Empirical Finance, 44, pp. 270-285, (2017); Boţoc, Claudiu, New empirical evidence on CEE's stock markets integration, World Economy, 43, 10, pp. 2785-2802, (2020); Journal of Portfolio Management, (1991); Review of Financial Studies, (1988); Economic and Social Development Esd 39 Th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development Sustainability from an Economic and Social Perspective, (2019); Daoud, Jamal Ibrahim, Multicollinearity and Regression Analysis, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 949, 1, (2018)","","VGTU","","","","","","20294433; 16111699","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100923919"

Contrary to previous studies, we relax the strong assumption of homogenous investors by adopting a frequency approach based on the wavelet methodology to measure the relationship between the bond market and macroeconomic stability through both the time and frequency dimensions. Our analysis reveals three main findings. First, the interaction between the bond market and macroeconomic variables is more pronounced in emerging economies than in developed economies. Second, the relationship between the bond market and macroeconomic indicators varies over time, as it is more pronounced during turmoil periods, and across frequencies, as we show that the relationship is observed in the short and medium (long) term for emerging (advanced) East Asian economies. Third, there is divergence in the relationship regarding the level and volatility of the macroeconomic indicators. Indeed, for emerging economies, the relationship is more pronounced in the first moments; however, for advanced economies, it is more pronounced in the second moments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Economies; Emerging Countries; Macroeconomic Stability; Nonlinear Granger Causality; Wavelet Coherence Approach","","","","","Analyse Compare and Apply Alternative Indicators and Monitoring Methodologies to Measure the Evolution of Capital Market Integration in the European Union, (2002); Aghion, Philippe, Contagious bank failures in a free banking system, European Economic Review, 44, 4-6, pp. 713-718, (2000); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Emerging Markets and the Global Economy: A Handbook, pp. 1-875, (2013); Determinants of Local Currency Bonds and Foreign Holdings Implications for Bond Market Development in the Peoples Republic of China, (2012); Baele, Lieven, Measuring European financial integration, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 20, 4, pp. 509-530, (2004); Baxter, Marianne, Business cycles and the asset structure of foreign trade, International Economic Review, 36, 4, pp. 821-854, (1995); Growth Volatility and Equity Market Liberalization, (2002); Bhattacharyay, Biswa Nath, Determinants of bond market development in Asia, Journal of Asian Economics, 24, pp. 124-137, (2013); Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo, Assessing the readiness of the BRICS grouping for mutually beneficial financial integration, Review of Development Economics, 21, 4, pp. e204-e219, (2017); Boubaker, Sabri, Financial development, government bond returns, and stability: International evidence, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 61, pp. 81-96, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","15729338; 02545330","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078809274"

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quarterly GDP and unemployment data manually collected from the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI). Accounting numbers are also collected from the Tehran Stock Exchange library for the 2004-2015 period. Dispersion of earnings growth provides related data about labour reallocation, unemployment change and finally aggregate output. To summarize, this study attempts to examine the effect of these variables using classical and Bayesian approaches. Findings: At a firm level, our results suggest that sectoral shift in previous years is likely to increase labour reallocation in subsequent years. At the macro level, the results reveal that dispersion of earnings growth and labour reallocation has a negative and positive impact on unemployment changes, respectively. However, the study suggests no significant relationship between stock return and unemployment changes. Consequently, we determine that the real estimates of macroeconomic indicators have predictive power because nominal estimates are not statistically associated with firm-level details. Finally, the results obtained from classical and Bayesian approaches suggest similar findings, thus confirming the robustness of our conclusions. Note that, based on Bayesian approach, the nominal reallocation has predictive power in unemployment rate. Originality/value: The study is the first conducted in a developing country and the results provide important insight into current line of accounting literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dispersion Of Earnings Growth; Firm-level Data; Labor Reallocation; Macroeconomic Indicators; Sectoral Shift; Stock Return Dispersion; Unemployment","","","","","Working Paper London School of Economics, (2017); Afonso, António, The macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy, Applied Economics, 44, 34, pp. 4439-4454, (2012); Arias, Javier, Trade, informal employment and labor adjustment costs, Journal of Development Economics, 133, pp. 396-414, (2018); Babajide, Abiola Ayopo, Stock market response to economic growth and interest rate volatility: Evidence from Nigeria, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 6, 1, pp. 354-360, (2016); Badu, Bismark, Value relevance of accounting information: an emerging country perspective, Journal of Accounting and Organizational Change, 14, 4, pp. 473-491, (2018); Ball, Ray, Aggregate earnings and why they matter, Journal of Accounting Literature, 34, pp. 39-57, (2015); Tilting the Evidence the Role of Firm Level Earnings Attributes in the Relation Between Aggregated Earnings and Gross Domestic Product, (2018); Baqaee, David Rezza, The Macroeconomic Impact of Microeconomic Shocks: Beyond Hulten's Theorem, Econometrica, 87, 4, pp. 1155-1203, (2019); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2016); Evolution in Value Relevance of Accounting Information, (2025)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","19348835","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084061578"

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted an advanced econometrics technique: the dynamic autoregressive-distributed lag (DARDL) and – the time-frequency domain approach known as the wavelet coherence test. The DARDL model was applied to identify the cointegrating relationships and the CWT was used to analyze the co-movement and lead–lag relationships among four states’ regional housing prices. The extracted data were mainly on annual basis and comprised macroeconomics and financial factors. Information with regard to residential prices and other variables was extracted from the National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) website, the Central Bank of Malaysia Statistics Report, the Department of Statistics, Malaysia, I-Property.com and the World Bank (WB). The data covered in this study were the pool data from four main states in Malaysia and different categories of residential properties. Findings: The empirical results indicate that there were long-run cointegration relationships between the housing price and capital gain and loss, rental per square feet, disposable income, inflation, number of marriages, deposit rate, risk premium and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. While the wavelet analysis shows that (1) in the long run, Kuala Lumpur housing price having strong co-movement with Selangor, Penang and Melaka housing prices except for Johor and (2) the lead–lag relationship also postulates Kuala Lumpur housing price having in-phase category with Selangor, Penang and Melaka housing prices except for Johor. Practical implications: This study offers relevant practical implications. First, the study proposes an active collaboration between the private sector and government support which may help to smooth the pricing issue of residential properties. More low-cost residential projects are needed for focus groups including middle- and low-income earners. Furthermore, the results are expected to provide real estate investor in Malaysia, an improved understanding of the regional housing market price dynamics. Originality/value: The findings of this study were obtained from various reliable sources; therefore, the results reflected the analysis of price drivers and co-movements. Furthermore, findings from this study lend some support to the argument on the rise of residential prices and offer several policy implications from a practical point of view with regard to the residential market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Buying; Drivers; Housing Affordability; Price; Property; Residential","","","","","Abduh, Muhamad, Islamic banking and economic growth: the Indonesian experience, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 5, 1, pp. 35-47, (2012); Akinci, Özge, How effective are macroprudential policies?

First, it intends to investigate the symmetric link between initial public offering (IPO) variability and the determinants of the stock market index, treasury bill rate, inflation, GDP growth rate and foreign direct investment. Second, this study intends to examine the asymmetric link between IPO variability and the aforementioned determinants, namely the stock market index, treasury bill rate, inflation, GDP growth rate and foreign direct investment. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 1992 to 2018 were gathered from the country of Pakistan in order to achieve the above objectives. Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) unit root tests were employed to determine the data's stationarity properties. The Auto Regressive Distributive Lags (ARDL) model was utilized to examine the symmetric links, and the Non-Linear Auto Regressive Distributive Lag Model (NARDL) was employed to determine the asymmetric links. While the long-run co-integration was examined using the ARDL bound test, the short-run dynamics were tested using the error correction method (ECM). Findings: The macroeconomic variables of the stock market index, treasury bill rate, inflation, GDP growth rate and foreign direct investment are found to pose significant short-run and long-run symmetric and asymmetric effects on IPO variability. These results indicate the significance of the aforementioned variables in enhancing IPO variability. The findings also demonstrate the typical reactions of inflation, GDP and FDI towards negative and positive shocks in IPO variability and inflation. This evidence implies that Pakistan's poor capital market development is reflected in the country's weak macroeconomic factors. At the same time, the reduced IPO variability in the country also reflects the lack of confidence among prospective issuers and investors due to Pakistan's weak macroeconomic indicators. Originality/value: This is the first study of its kind to properly investigate the symmetric and asymmetric effects of the macroeconomic variables on Pakistan's IPO variability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Foreign Direct Investment; Gdp Growth Rate; Inflation; Pakistani Ipo; Stock Market Index; Treasury Bill Rate","","","","The long-run asymmetric ARDL coefficients are shown in . TBR and NIPO have a significantly negative correlation at the 1% significance level. A 1% increase in TBR is shown to result in a 6.3% decrease in NIPO. Higher government borrowings via treasury bill issuances have an impact on the stock market by causing investors' portfolio balances to rebalance. Low TBRs are expected to stimulate domestic funds transfer from the money market to the stock market. Long-term capital demand for private firm securities is negatively affected by persistently high fiscal deficits, as well as the issuance of high-yielding but low-risk government instruments such as treasury bills. Investors are enticed to purchase additional government instruments due to the high yields on treasury bills. As a result, treasury bills are regarded as a resource for investors alongside stocks and bonds, which are likely to reduce demand for stock market instruments and, as a result, IPO variability. This finding is supported by previous research ().","Aggarwal, Reena, Portfolio preferences of foreign institutional investors, Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, 12, pp. 2919-2946, (2005); Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, (2007); Ameer, Rashid, Macroeconomic factors and initial public offerings (IPOs) in Malaysia, Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, 8, 1, pp. 41-67, (2012); Angelini, Eliana, The relationship between IPO and macroeconomics factors: An empirical analysis from UK market, Annals of Economics and Finance, 19, 1, pp. 319-336, (2018); Sbp Research Bulletin, (2017); Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen, Asymmetry Effects of Exchange Rate Changes on Domestic Production: Evidence from Nonlinear ARDL Approach, Australian Economic Papers, 55, 3, pp. 181-191, (2016); Brau, James C., The Choice of IPO versus Takeover: Empirical Evidence, Journal of Business, 76, 4, pp. 583-612, (2003); Determinants of Initial Public Offerings A European Time Series Cross Section Analysis, (2002); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1975); Qfinance, (2014)","","ESAN University","","","","","","22180648; 20771886","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121097033"

As indicated by the breaking unit‐root test, dummies for the global financial crisis and COVID‐19 were incorporated in the analyses. VAR results showed that the Indian bond market responds positively to the previous change in the Chinese bond market during the BRIC era while BRICS bond markets are mostly uninfluenced by prior behavior patterns of one another. These suggested that the diversification opportunity has been increased following the admission of South Africa to the league. In addition, variance decomposition and impulse response provide proofs to suggest that BRICS bond markets are more exogenous and independent compared to what is obtained during the BRIC period. Consequently, the authors concluded that the BRICS bloc has provided greater diversification opportunities for emerging markets’ bondholders in the recent past. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bond Market; Bric; Brics; Diversification; Var Modeinterdependence","","","","","Alexander, Carol O., Are foreign exchange markets really efficient?, Economics Letters, 40, 4, pp. 449-453, (1992); undefined; Journal of Management Sciences, (2017); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2011); Bekaert, Geert, Emerging markets finance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 10, 1-2, pp. 3-55, (2003); Bianconi, Marcelo, BRIC and the U.S. financial crisis: An empirical investigation of stock and bond markets, Emerging Markets Review, 14, 1, pp. 76-109, (2013); Introductory Econometrics for Finance, (2002); Campbell, John Y., What Moves the Stock and Bond Markets?

It also investigates the effect of these factors on the stock markets of both economies. The impact of these variables on broad market indices and sectoral indices is investigated and compared too. Design/methodology/approach: The publications for the study were retrieved from databases such as Emerald Insight, EBSCO, ScienceDirect and JSTOR using the keywords “Macroeconomic variables” and “Stock market” or “Stock market performance.” The result demonstrated a growing corpus of scholarly work in the domain of stock market. The study was carried out separately for each macroeconomic indicator. Given a large number of articles under consideration, the authors began by reading the titles and abstracts of all publications to identify those that were relevant. The papers are evaluated in Excel and the articles for review range from 1972 to 2021. Findings: The authors found that gross domestic product (GDP), FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and FII (Foreign Institutional Investment) have a positive effect on both emerging and developed economies’ stock market while gold price has a negative effect. Interest rates had a negative impact on both economies except for a few developing countries. The relationship with oil prices was positive for oil exporting countries while negative for oil importing countries. Inflation, money supply and GDP are the macroeconomic variables that have the same effect on sectoral indices as they do on broad market indices. The impact was sector-specific for the remaining variables. Research limitations/implications: This paper gives an overview of relation and effect covering variety of macroeconomic variables and stock market indices. Still, there is a scope for further research to analyze the effect on thematic, strategy and sectoral indices. A longer time horizon with new variables, such as bank deposit growth rate, nonperforming assets of banks, consumer confidence index and investor sentiment, can be studied using high-frequency data. This research may help stakeholders adopt and manage their policies during a crisis or economic slump. Practical implications: This study will assist investors, researchers and educators in the fields of economics and finance in understanding how macroeconomic factors affect the stock market. Furthermore, this study can guide in portfolio diversification strategy across multiple sectors by examining the impact of macroeconomic factors specific to sectoral indices. This paper provides insight into society and researchers since it integrates a number of macroeconomic variables and their interaction with the stock market. It may also help pension funds and mutual fund firms to hedge their funds and allocate equity portfolios. Originality/value: With respect to India, this study looked at new macroeconomic variables and sectors. It contrasted the impact of these variables in developed and developing economies. The effect of broad and sectoral stock indexes was also investigated and compared. The authors examined how these variables responded during crisis and economic downturns by using articles from a longer time frame. This research also looked into how changing the frequency of data for the variables altered stock performance. This paper emphasized the need for more research into thematic, strategy and broad market indices, such as small-cap and mid-cap indices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adf Test; Ardl; Garch; Johansen Cointegration Test; Macroeconomic Variables; Regression; Stock Index; Stock Market; Vecm","","","","Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.

We use insights from the labor economics literature to characterize the information contained in aggregate GAAP earnings and its components that is relevant for predicting aggregate job creation and destruction. Our results suggest that not only does aggregate earnings news convey information about future labor market aggregates, but its information content is incremental to other macroeconomic variables at near-term horizons. Further, the source of this information stems primarily from two earnings components: aggregate core earnings and special items. Shocks to core earnings signal persistent changes in economy-wide profitability that predict aggregate job creation up to four quarters ahead, while shocks to special items predict job destruction up to one quarter. Taken together, our results suggest that aggregate earnings contain useful information about future labor market conditions, with the nature of such information varying across earnings components. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aggregate Earnings; Job Flows; Labor Market; Special Items","","","","We thank David C.

The research sample used 31 bonds issued by the company during the 2015–2019 period. The data analysis method to estimate the determinant of bond yield uses multiple regression models. The results prove that the increase in the coupon rate causes bond yields to increase, while the inflation rate has the opposite effect of decreasing bond yield. Interest rate, exchange rate, duration, and bond rating variables cannot affect the bond yield. The results of this study imply that investors will be interested in investing in bonds with better yields if the company has to set a higher coupon rate, especially in economic conditions that experience low inflation rates. Interest rates and exchange rates as macroeconomic variables have not been considered by investors in purchasing bonds. Bond characteristic factors, namely, the duration and rating of the bonds, are considered less important factors in bond investment decisions because they are more oriented towards getting higher yields. Therefore, further research needs to be explored further related to the behavior of Indonesian bond investors who may have different characters from investors in other countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Bond Yield; Indonesia Stock Exchange; Infrastructure Companies","","","","","Asian Academy of Management Journal, (2009); Alhempi, Raden Rudi, Tax compliance in income tax payments, International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change, 13, 1, pp. 356-374, (2020); Anwar, Cep Jandi, Monetary Policy Independence and Bond Yield in Developing Countries, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 7, 11, pp. 023-031, (2020); Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, (2015); Bhojraj, Sanjeev, Effect of Corporate Governance on Bond Ratings and Yields: The Role of Institutional Investors and Outside Directors, Journal of Business, 76, 3, pp. 455-475, (2003); Policy Research Working, (2000); Che-Yahya, Norliza, Determinants of corporate bond yield: The case of Malaysian bond market, International Journal of Business and Society, 17, 2, pp. 245-258, (2016); Chen, Long, Corporate yield spreads and bond liquidity, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 119-149, (2007); Chen, Tsungkang, Internal liquidity risk in corporate bond yield spreads, Journal of Banking and Finance, 35, 4, pp. 978-987, (2011); El Ouadghiri, Imane, On the impact of macroeconomic news surprises on Treasury-bond returns, Annals of Finance, 12, 1, pp. 29-53, (2016)","","Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA)","","","","","","22884645; 22884637","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103330566"

However, many researchers have found that the stock market is not always in the lead, especially for the emerging markets, and the leading role of different sector indices is also different for the corresponding sectors. From the perspective of a comparison between mature market and emerging market at sectoral level, this paper utilizes the thermal optimal method to examine the dynamic lead-lag relationships between stock sector indices and macroeconomic variables for the USA and China. The results show that, for the US stock market, three sector indices including consumption, industry, and real estate have been leading the corresponding macroeconomic variables since 2013; for the Chinese stock market, the lead-lag relationships are different for these sectors. The real estate sector index and the industry sector index have been leading the corresponding macroeconomic variables since 2010, and the lead-lag relationship between the consumption sector index and the total retail sales is not always positive or negative, which means that the consumption sector index does not always lead the total retail sales. The empirical results confirm that the ""barometer function""of immature stock market is still weak and easier to be disabled by factors such as irrational market sentiment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Barometers; Commerce; Sales; Chinese Stock Market; Emerging Markets; Industry Sectors; Macroeconomic Variables; Mature Markets; Optimal Methods; Relationship Between Stocks; Retail Sales; Financial Markets","Barometers; Commerce; Sales; Chinese stock market; Emerging markets; Industry sectors; Macroeconomic variables; Mature markets; Optimal methods; Relationship between stocks; Retail sales; Financial markets","","","","Theory of Economic Development, (1934); Atje, Raymond, Stock markets and development, European Economic Review, 37, 2-3, pp. 632-640, (1993); Abugri, Benjamin A., Empirical relationship between macroeconomic volatility and stock returns: Evidence from Latin American markets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 17, 2, pp. 396-410, (2008); Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen, Do exchange rate changes have symmetric or asymmetric effects on stock prices?, Global Finance Journal, 31, pp. 57-72, (2016); Schwert, G.

This study uses panel data namely GDP per-capita, exchange rate, and inflation as the proxies for macroeconomic stability sourced from the World Development Index, and six dimensions of Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as institutional proxies sourced from WGI-World Bank. To make robust the relationship between macroeconomics and institutional on the global sukuk market, the population (POP) variable was included as a control variable. The development of sukuk uses a proxy for sukuk issuance in the International Islamic Financial Market, for the annual period from 2002-2017. The data was analyzed using the General Method of Moment, and the results show that by controlling the population effects that proved to be significant, GDP per-capita and the rule of law have a significant impact on the development of sukuk, especially when incorporating population effects as control variables, whereby further ascertaining the effect of each macroeconomic-stability variable and institutional stability on sukuk development, especially inflation, found not to affect sukuk development.

SVM as a nonparametric binary classification technique is already a widely used method in financial time series forecasting. In the literature, a bubble is often defined as a situation where the asset price exceeds its fundamental value. As one of the early warning signals, prediction of bubbles is vital for policymakers and regulators who are responsible to take preemptive measures against the future crises. Therefore, many attempts have been made to understand the main factors in bubble formation and to predict them in their earlier phases. Our analysis consists of two steps. The first step is to identify the bubbles in the S&P 500 index using a widely recognized right-tailed unit root test. Then, SVM is employed to predict the bubbles by macroeconomic indicators. Also, we compare SVM with different supervised learning algorithms by using k-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that the proposed approach with high predictive power could be a favourable alternative in bubble prediction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bubbles; Early Warning; Machine Learning; Macroeconomic Indicators; Support Vector Machines","","","","The authors thank to the Associate Editor and the anonymous Reviewers for their valuable suggestions and corrections.","Astill, Sam, Tests for an end-of-sample bubble in financial time series, Econometric Reviews, 36, 6-9, pp. 651-666, (2017); Żbikowski, Kamil, Using Volume Weighted Support Vector Machines with walk forward testing and feature selection for the purpose of creating stock trading strategy, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 4, pp. 1797-1805, (2015); Böser, Bernhard E., Training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers, pp. 144-152, (1992); Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Chen, Yingjun, A feature weighted support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor algorithm for stock market indices prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 80, pp. 340-355, (2017); Chong, Eunsuk, Deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction: Methodology, data representations, and case studies, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 187-205, (2017); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2015); undefined; Asset Price Bubblesthe New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance; Harvey, David I., Tests for explosive financial bubbles in the presence of non-stationary volatility, Journal of Empirical Finance, 38, Part B, pp. 548-574, (2016)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","02664763; 13600532","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091464751"

We find that M&As announced on days of the release of key macroeconomic indicators (i.e. indicator days) realize higher announcement period risk-adjusted returns compared to counterparts announced on non-indicator days. The positive wealth effect is due to the higher market attention on indicator days, which is particularly relevant for smaller M&As that are not usually exposed to significant investor scrutiny. The results hold after addressing self-selection bias concerns. We also find that firms announcing M&As on indicator days are more likely to “listen” to the market's feedback. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Buy-and-hold Abnormal Returns; Investor Attention; Macroeconomic Indicators; Mergers And Acquisitions (m&as); Risk-adjusted Returns; Small Deals","","","","We are grateful for comments and suggestions from Viral Acharya, Bart Lambrecht (the editor), Jeffrey Wurgler, two anonymous reviewers, and the participants of the 16th INFINITI Conference on International Finance, Glasgow, Scotland, UK, June 2018, and the 6th Paris Financial Management Conference, Paris, France, December 2018, as well as the seminar series on the University of Cardiff, Business School.

Examining 24 emerging markets, we find that both investable and non-investable firms are sensitive to local monetary policy shocks. This allays the concern that emerging-market opening reduces the efficacy of local monetary policy. We also find that in 11 countries (46% of our country-sample), investable firms are more sensitive to local shocks than non-investable firms.

We implement a multifactor model to estimate the unobservable time-varying risk exposure conditional on macroeconomic information and a VAR to measure the impact of macroeconomic predictors on different time horizons. Using monthly returns on a cross-section of 10 different style indices from February 1997 to August 2019, we find that, on average, macroeconomic indicators explain approximately 30%, 55%, and 75% of the variability of betas at 1-, 6-, and 36-month horizons, respectively. Although macroeconomic predictors play a critical role at every horizon, at 1 month, the dominating effect comes from idiosyncratic shocks, which indicates that in the short run, hedge fund managers rely mostly on their own reallocation signals. Moreover, consistent with the fundamental drivers of the smart beta factors, we find that the interest rate level and GDP growth similarly impact hedge fund exposures across styles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conditional Betas; Factor Tilting; Kalman Filter; Macroeconomic Indicators","","","","The authors are very grateful to the editor, Sushanta Mallick, an Associate Editor, and three anonymous referees for their truly helpful comments and suggestions regarding previous versions of the paper.

The aim of this paper is to assess the short-term reaction of the Visegrad countries' financial markets to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Visegrad Group is a political alliance of four Central European countries, namely Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. The financial assessment is based on the EUR/CZK, EUR/HUF, and EUR/PLN exchange rates and the major blue-chip stock market indices, that is Prague PX, Budapest BUX, Warsaw WIG20, and Bratislava SAX. It is evident that the ongoing pandemic has changed the expectations of the financial market participants about the future value of exchange rates in the Visegrad countries. This study indicates that, as a consequence of COVID-19, higher probability has been attached to the large depreciation of the Czech koruna (CZK), the Hungarian forint (HUF), and the Polish zloty (PLN) than to their large appreciation. Moreover, based on the TGARCH model, the positive and significant correlation between the number of reported COVID-19 cases and the exchange rates has been confirmed, implying that the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the depreciation of the Visegrad currencies. Additionally, the result of the TGARCH model reveals that there is a significant and negative link between the Visegrad stock market indices and the COVID-19 spread. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Czechia; Financial Markets; Government Response; Hungary; Macroeconomic Indicators; Poland; Sars-cov-2; Slovakia; Visegrad Group (v4); Disease Spread; Financial Market; Market Conditions; Probability; Stock Market; Virus; Europe; Coronavirus; Sars Coronavirus","disease spread; financial market; market conditions; probability; stock market; virus; Europe; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus","","","","Goodell, John W., COVID-19 and finance: Agendas for future research, Finance Research Letters, 35, (2020); Maier, Benjamin Frank, Effective containment explains subexponential growth in recent confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, Science, 368, 6492, pp. 742-746, (2020); Global Economic Effects of Pandemic Influenza, (2011); Andersen, Kristian G., The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2, Nature Medicine, 26, 4, pp. 450-452, (2020); Corman, Victor Max, Hosts and Sources of Endemic Human Coronaviruses, Advances in Virus Research, 100, pp. 163-188, (2018); Ge, Xingyi, Metagenomic analysis of viruses from bat fecal samples reveals many novel viruses in insectivorous bats in China, Journal of Virology, 86, 8, pp. 4620-4630, (2012); Ge, Xingyi, Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor, Nature, 503, 7477, pp. 535-538, (2013); Johns Hopkins University Covid 19 Map Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center; Global Impact of Covid 19 and Strategies for Mitigation and Suppression, (2020); Laing, Timothy J., The economic impact of the Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-2019): Implications for the mining industry, Extractive Industries and Society, 7, 2, pp. 580-582, (2020)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089903451"

We evaluate the prediction performance with the Jórda-Schularick-Taylor dataset, which includes the crisis dates and annual macroeconomic series of 17 countries over the period 1870−2016. Previous literature has found that simple neural net architectures are useful and outperform the traditional logistic regression model in predicting systemic financial crises. We show that such predictions can be significantly improved by making use of the Long-Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (RNN-GRU) neural nets. Behind the success is the recurrent networks’ ability to make more robust predictions from the time series data.

With the methods of factor analysis, the VAR model, and the GARCH model, selecting 11 indicators related to the agricultural production conditions and rural economy in Heilongjiang Province from 2012 to 2017 as the macroeconomic indicators, and 8 indicators related to credit risk management and asset quality supervision in Heilongjiang Province within the 72 months from 2012 to 2017 as the microeconomic indicators, this paper conducted empirical research on the risk measurement of mortgage loans on rural land contract and management rights in Heilongjiang Province. The VAR of the risks of mortgage loans on rural land contract and management rights was calculated with the VAR-GARCH (1, 1) model. The VAR line chart showed that the risks of mortgage loans on rural land contract and management rights in Heilongjiang Province were at a lower level in 2012, at a stably high level from 2013 to 2016, and then relieved to some extent in 2017.

Long-run elasticity results show that the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is not valid for emerging markets. Besides, long-run findings reveal that fossil fuel energy consumption has a powerful negative impact on the environmental quality of emerging markets. Moreover, long-run findings of emerging markets show that 1% increase in financial development raises CO<inf>2</inf> emissions at 0.76% level. Considering empirical findings, emerging markets should tend to use environmentally friendly technologies to avoid the possible environmental problems caused by pollution. Therefore, green energy investors should be supported by possible incentive policies. In addition, emerging markets should turn towards financial regulations, which extend credit channels for clean industries whereby emerging countries could achieve their sustainable development goals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emerging Markets; Energy Consumption; Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis; Financial Development; Pooled Mean Group; Carbon Dioxide; Commerce; Energy Utilization; Environmental Impact; Environmental Technology; Fossil Fuels; Investments; Sustainable Development; Carbon Dioxide Emissions; Emerging Markets; Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis; Environmental Problems; Environmentally-friendly Technology; Financial Development; Gross Domestic Products; Pooled Mean Group; Economic And Social Effects; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Economic Growth; Energy Use; Environmental Economics; Environmental Impact; Finance; Fossil Fuel; Gross Domestic Product; Panel Data","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Investments; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Emerging markets; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental problems; Environmentally-friendly technology; Financial development; Gross domestic products; pooled mean group; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; energy use; environmental economics; environmental impact; finance; fossil fuel; Gross Domestic Product; panel data","","","","undefined, (2016); undefined, (2017); Dincer, I., Renewable energy and sustainable development: A crucial review, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 4, 2, pp. 157-175, (2000); undefined, (2016); Alcántara, Vicent, Energy and CO2 emissions in Spain.

In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) and three other methods for factor extraction are compared based on their deterministic and probabilistic forecasting performances using factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) models. The existing PCA-based methods use only the contemporaneous covariance matrix of the data, while the other methods rely on weighted lagged cross-covariance matrices. Our empirical study considers four crude oil future price instruments and a 241 variable dataset of global energy prices and quantity, macroeconomic indicators, and financial series which are thought to influence oil price movements. Overall empirical findings are: (1) the PCA-based method performs better at shorter forecast horizons whereas the new methods involving lagged cross-covariance matrices tend to perform better at longer horizons (2 months or greater); (2) the performance ranking of the four methods under both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting is greatly affected by the number of factors included in the FAVAR models; (3) the forecast performances of the four methods are close to each other and no method performs uniformly better than the others. More research on the role of temporal dependence in determining the number of factors is warranted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Energy Price Forecasting; Evaluating Forecasts; Favar; Large Data Set; Probability Forecasting; Covariance Analysis; Data Set; Forecasting Method; Matrix; Oil Supply; Price Determination; Principal Component Analysis; Probability; Temporal Variation; Vector Autoregression","covariance analysis; data set; forecasting method; matrix; oil supply; price determination; principal component analysis; probability; temporal variation; vector autoregression","","","","Alessi, Lucia, Improved penalization for determining the number of factors in approximate factor models, Statistics and Probability Letters, 80, 23-24, pp. 1806-1813, (2010); Alquist, Ron, What do we learn from the price of crude oil futures?, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 25, 4, pp. 539-573, (2010); Apergis, Nicholas, Precious metal markets, stock markets and the macroeconomic environment: a FAVAR model approach, Applied Financial Economics, 24, 10, pp. 691-703, (2014); Bai, Jushan, Determining the number of factors in approximate factor models, Econometrica, 70, 1, pp. 191-221, (2002); Banerjee, Anindya, Forecasting with factor-augmented error correction models, International Journal of Forecasting, 30, 3, pp. 589-612, (2014); Barnett, Alina, Forecasting UK GDP growth and inflation under structural change.

With a continuous wavelet coherency and partial coherency approach and monthly data of Japan and US from January 1960 to May 2017, this paper contributes to the literature by examining the characteristics of the dependence of unemployment on real input prices across frequencies and over time. The empirical results indicate that: First, a rise in real oil price leads to productivity growth slowdown and unemployment increase at the scale of 16–64 months after 1990 for Japan and 8–24 months after 2005 for US. Second, an increase in real interest rate results in higher unemployment at the 16–32-month scale before 1974 for Japan and 8–64-month scale before 2000 for US. Third, the degree of integration between labour market and energy market in US is higher than that in Japan. This study provides time-frequency evidence to the supply side hypothesis about the relationships between input prices and unemployment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Wavelet Analysis; Real Interest Rate; Real Oil Price; Unemployment; Wavelet Coherency; Wavelet Partial Coherency; Frequency Analysis; Interest Rate; Labor Market; Oil Trade; Price Determination; Price Dynamics; Unemployment; Wavelet Analysis; Japan; United States","frequency analysis; interest rate; labor market; oil trade; price determination; price dynamics; unemployment; wavelet analysis; Japan; United States","","","","Aguiar-Conraria, Luís, Using wavelets to decompose the time-frequency effects of monetary policy, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 387, 12, pp. 2863-2878, (2008); Continuous Wavelet Transform A Primer, (2011); Business and Economics Research Journal, (2013); Andreopoulos, Spyros, Oil matters: Real input prices and U.S. unemployment revisited, B.E.

By using the Autoregressive Distributed-Lag (ARDL) bounds tests, followed by the error correction model for short term dynamics and robustness tests for the stability of the model, the key findings showed that the VN-Index was significantly influenced by all the selected variables in the long term. The outcomes contributed to the current literature by clarifying the determinants of stock prices from monetary policy perspective within the context of an emerging economy and then providing relevant recommendations for enhancing the performance of the Vietnamese stock market. The remaining money supply expansion and the local currency appreciation, while controlling inflation, domestic credit, and reducing refinancing rate can promote the progress of the Vietnamese securities market.

Moreover, we take into account the effect of three crises observed from 2005 to 2009. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) model for examining the short-run and long-run effect across various quantiles of the dependent variables and compare its' results standard autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. Findings: ARDL estimates indicate that, in the long-run, industrial production index, trade balance and foreign direct investment significantly affect stock prices. These findings remain same when three crises have been taken into consideration. In addition, estimates from QARDL model indicate that, in the short-run, the effect of exchange rate, interest rate, consumer price index and foreign direct investment, varies across bearish, bullish and normal states of the overall stock prices. Moreover, the short-run findings for Auto Assembler, Cement, Commercial Banks sector are consistent with overall stock indices, whereas other sectors, such as, Oil and Gas and Power Generation and distribution are asymmetrically affected by all macroeconomic variables. In the long-run, the effect of all macro-variables varies across different states of the stock markets except industrial production index for Auto Assembler sector, Oil and Gas sector and composite index of KSE 100 index. Originality/value: We take into account the effect of three crises observed from 2005 to 2009 and also examine the macroeconomic effect across bullish, bearish and normal states of the sectorial stock indices and composite index of Pakistan stock exchange.

Knowing which sectors flourish at different phases of the business cycle, investment returns may be boosted by increasing holdings in securities from strengthening sectors and reducing holdings in weakening ones. As the business cycle phase changes, security rotation can continuously improve portfolio returns. Sector investing is, however, heavily dependent upon accurate phase identification and therefore highly vulnerable to phase misidentification. Investing in securities which do not thrive at the phase identified could lead to inferior portfolio returns or even losses. There is ample precedent in the literature regarding the usefulness of Fourier analysis in identifying business cycle frequencies. This article contributes by installing this approach for the first time to augment existing sector investing methodology. We confirm that the sector rotation approach does generate statistically significant outperformance (relative to local market index performance) in South Africa. This work adds to the current dearth of theoretical and empirical research regarding sector rotation in emerging economies, so it can also be beneficial for researchers interested in similar milieus. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Cycle; Efficient Frontier; Fourier Analysis; Sector Investing","","","","","Stock Price Cycles and Business Cycles, (2019); Andersen, Torben G., Real-time price discovery in global stock, bond and foreign exchange markets, Journal of International Economics, 73, 2, pp. 251-277, (2007); IMF Staff Papers, (2002); Arshad, Shaista, The vicissitudes of stock markets and business cycles: focusing on the OIC region, Macroeconomics and Finance in Emerging Market Economies, 9, 1, pp. 56-74, (2016); Askey, Richard A., Similarities between fourier and power series, American Mathematical Monthly, 103, 4, pp. 297-304, (1996); Avramov, Doron, Investing in mutual funds when returns are predictable, Journal of Financial Economics, 81, 2, pp. 339-377, (2006); Bekaert, Geert, Emerging equity market volatility, Journal of Financial Economics, 43, 1, pp. 29-77, (1997); Benson, Karen Leigh, Portfolio Construction and Performance Measurement when Returns are Non-Normal, Australian Journal of Management, 32, 3, pp. 445-461, (2008); Essentials of Investments, (2004); Boehm, Ernst A., Analysing and forecasting business cycles with the aid of economic indicators, International Journal of Management Reviews, 1, 3, pp. 245-277, (1999)","","Cogent OA","","","","","","23322039","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097161077"

The data is updated to the period for which monthly data are available from January 1986 to June 2018 (390 observations) retrieved from the Bank of Korea. The results of Johansen cointegration test indicate that at least one cointegrating equation exists, confirming there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock prices in Korea. The results of vector error correction estimates confirm that: 1) the coefficient of the error correction term is significant with a negative sign, which is, a long-run dynamic relationship is observed between macroeconomic variables and stock prices; 2) for short-run dynamics, the nominal exchange rate of the Korean won per the US dollar is positively related to stock prices, while interest rates are negatively related to stock prices in the short-run; 3) the coefficient of global financial crises is insignificant, that is, the changes of stock prices are determined largely by their own dynamics in the model. The results suggest only that the global financial crises neither cause instability in the cointegrating vector, nor affect significant changes in the endogenous variables in the model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causality; Global Financial Crisis; Korea; Macroeconomic Variables; Stock Prices","","","","","J Manag Res, (2008); African Journal of Business Management, (2012); European Scientific Journal, (2014); Journal of Financial Studies Research, (2016); Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen, On the relation between stock prices and exchange rates: a review article, Journal of Economic Studies, 42, 4, pp. 707-732, (2015); Basistha, Arabinda, Macroeconomic cycles and the stock market's reaction to monetary policy, Journal of Banking and Finance, 32, 12, pp. 2606-2616, (2008); Bilson, Christopher M., Selecting macroeconomic variables as explanatory factors of emerging stock market returns, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 9, 4, pp. 401-426, (2001); Bjørnland, Hilde Christiane, Identifying the interdependence between US monetary policy and the stock market, Journal of Monetary Economics, 56, 2, pp. 275-282, (2009); Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, (2007); Brahmasrene, Tantatape, Crude oil prices and exchange rates: Causality, variance decomposition and impulse response, Energy Economics, 44, pp. 407-412, (2014)","","Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA)","","","","","","22884645; 22884637","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097078533"

The purpose of the present research is to fill this gap by using the state-of-the-art econometric technique of wavelets to understand how differences in the horizon of analysis across time impact international housing markets’ relationship with some of the key macroeconomic variables. The purpose is to also analyze the direction of causation in the relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The author uses the novel time–frequency analysis of international housing markets’ linkages to the macroeconomic drivers. Unlike conventional approaches that do not distinguish between time and frequency domain, the author uses wavelets to study house prices’ relationship with its drivers in the time–frequency space. The novelty of the approach also allows gaining insights into the debates that deal with the direction of causation between house price changes and macroeconomic variables. Findings: Results show that the relationship between house prices and key macroeconomic indicators varies significantly across countries, time, frequencies and the direction of causation. House prices are most related to interest rates at the higher frequencies (short-run) and per capita income growth at the lower frequencies (long-run). The role of industrial production and income growth has switched over time at lower frequencies, particularly, in Finland, France, Sweden and Japan. The stock market’s nexus with the housing market is significant mainly at high to medium frequencies around the recent financial crisis. Research limitations/implications: The present research implies that in contrast to the existing approaches that are limited to the only time domain, the frequency considerations are equally, if not more, important. Practical implications: Results show that interested researchers and analysts of international housing markets need to account for the both horizon and time under consideration. Because the factors that drive high-frequency movements in housing market are very different from low-frequency movements. Furthermore, these roles vary over time. Social implications: The insights from the present study suggest policymakers interested in bringing social change in the housing markets need to account for the time–frequency dynamics found in this study. Originality/value: The paper is novel on at least two dimensions. First, to the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to propose the use of a time–frequency approach in modeling international housing market dynamics. Second, unlike present studies, it is the first to uncover the direction of causation between house prices and economic variables for each frequency at every point of time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Housing Prices; International Housing Markets; Macroeconomic Fundamentals; Macroeconomics; Time-frequency Housing Dynamics; Wavelet Analysis","","","","","Adams, Zeno, Macroeconomic determinants of international housing markets, Journal of Housing Economics, 19, 1, pp. 38-50, (2010); Addo, Peter Martey, Nonlinear Dynamics and Wavelets for Business Cycle Analysis, Dynamic Modeling and Econometrics in Economics and Finance, 20, pp. 73-100, (2014); Aguiar-Conraria, Luís, Oil and the macroeconomy: Using wavelets to analyze old issues, Empirical Economics, 40, 3, pp. 645-655, (2011); Aguiar-Conraria, Luís, Oil Shocks and the Euro as an Optimum Currency Area, Dynamic Modeling and Econometrics in Economics and Finance, 20, pp. 143-156, (2014); Aloui, Chaker, Co-movements of GCC emerging stock markets: New evidence from wavelet coherence analysis, Economic Modelling, 36, pp. 421-431, (2014); Housing Markets and Structural Policies in OECD Countries, (2011); House Prices and Monetary Policy in the Euro Area, (2005); Baxa, Jaromír, Time-varying monetary-policy rules and financial stress: Does financial instability matter for monetary policy?, Journal of Financial Stability, 9, 1, pp. 117-138, (2013); Monetary Policy and the Housing Bubble, (2010); Bloomfield, D.

The research aims to investigate the association between specific internals and macroeconomic factors and the financial performance of insurance companies in Ethiopia. A quantitative approach is applied in this research by adopting inferential statistics with a balanced panel data of nine insurance companies for 15 years (2002–2016). Explanatory analysis is deployed where Pearson’s correlation and OLS regression model are applied to examine the association between dependent and independent variables. GDP per capita and size of the companies demonstrate a positive and significant association, whereas leverage, liquidity, and underwriting risk are negative but significant with returns of assets. The growth of assets accelerates financial performance through the establishment of more branches and improved living situation of the people. Additionally, reduction of underwriting risk by transferring surplus risk to the reinsurers, managing capital structure with minimum dependence on borrowed capital, and deployment of premium earned in return fetching investments speed up the financial performance of insurance companies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Performance; Gdp Per Capita; Leverage; Liquidity; Market Share; Return Of Assets; Size; Underwriting Risk","","","","","Adams, Mike B., The determinants of corporate financial performance in the Bermuda insurance market, Applied Financial Economics, 13, 2, pp. 133-143, (2003); Ahmed, Naveed, Determinants of performance: A case of life insurance sector of Pakistan, International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 61, pp. 123-128, (2011); Oscar Akotey, Joseph, The financial performance of life insurance companies in Ghana, Journal of Risk Finance, 14, 3, pp. 286-302, (2013); International Journal of Business and Social Science, (2011); Journal of Management Research, (2012); Bank Specific Industry Specific and Macroeconomic Determinants of Bank Profitability, (2005); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Sciences, (2014); Beck, Thorsten, Economic, demographic, and institutional determinants of life insurance consumption across countries, World Bank Economic Review, 17, 1, pp. 51-88, (2003); Berry-Stölzle, Thomas R., Determinants of Corporate Diversification: Evidence From the Property-Liability Insurance Industry, Journal of Risk and Insurance, 79, 2, pp. 381-413, (2012); Chen, Renbao, The determinants of financial health of Asian insurance companies, Journal of Risk and Insurance, 71, 3, pp. 469-499, (2004)","","De la Salle University","","","","","","2243786X; 01167111","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093909579"

The period of the study is 1990m1 to 2017m5. The wavelet coherency results reveal that there are important and significant relations between the fuel and food prices, the fuel and industrial prices, and the fuel and metal prices. These results also show that there are phase relationships between those paired prices. The volatility spillover results indicate that the agricultural sector is the most affected by shocks from the other markets. The return series of the industrial input prices at all frequencies appears to be the main source of volatility transmission to the prices of the other commodities over the whole period.

In this study we examine the underlying cause(s) of this asymmetric correlation in stock returns. We find that firms’ cash flow news and other indicators of firm operating performance have asymmetric correlations that mimic that of stock returns. We also find that other potential causes of asymmetric correlation, such as trading activities, arbitrage constraints, conditional conservatism, and earnings management, exhibit insignificant (or marginally significant at best) asymmetric correlations. We further find that the asymmetric correlation observed in stock returns is significantly related to those in firm operating performance.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an autoregressive distributed lag model by using the full sample period data from 1997Q3 to 2018Q2 and the post-crisis period data from 2008Q3 to 2018Q2. Moreover, it uses variance decomposition analysis to examine the importance of each variable in explaining SP. Findings: The findings of the full sample period indicate that in the long run, TB, exchange rate and IR negatively affect SP whereas CPI and industrial production positively affect SP. However, the post-crisis period data indicate that only CPI positively affects the SP in the long run. Finally, variance decomposition analysis indicates 30 percent variance in SP is explained by its own shock. Practical implications: The study findings suggest that macroeconomic variables have a significant role and can be considered important for taking investment and/or policy decisions. Especially, Governments and other regulators may need to take measures to increase the TB since it can help to increase the performance of the Pakistani stock market. Furthermore, investors may consider that findings change when the financial crisis has been taken into consideration. Originality/value: This study uses two additional variables, namely FDI and TB by using the robust technique in the context of emerging countries like Pakistan. Furthermore, it takes into account the impact of the financial crisis on the underlying variables. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ardl Model; Financial Crisis; Macroeconomic Variables; Stock Prices","","","","","Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics, (1993); Adeel-Farooq, Rana Muhammad, Trade openness, financial liberalization and economic growth: The case of Pakistan and India, South Asian Journal of Business Studies, 6, 3, pp. 229-246, (2017); Akron Business and Economic Review, (1981); International Journal of Business and Management, (2010); Ajaz, Taufeeq, Stock prices, exchange rate and interest rate: evidence beyond symmetry, Journal of Financial Economic Policy, 9, 1, pp. 2-19, (2017); Akbar, Muhammad Ali, Bayesian analysis of dynamic linkages among gold price, stock prices, exchange rate and interest rate in Pakistan, Resources Policy, 62, pp. 154-164, (2019); Journal of Business Management and Economics, (2012); Andrieş, Alin Marius, Analyzing time-frequency relationship between interest rate, stock price and exchange rate through continuous wavelet, Economic Modelling, 41, pp. 227-238, (2014); International Journal of Economics and Financial Research, (2017); Co Integration Error Correction and the Econometric Analysis of Non Stationary Data, (1993)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","23986298; 2398628X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073983554"

Macroeconomic factors show the prosperity of any economic system and determine the investment future. Macroeconomic factors influence pricing in any economy. Macroeconomic vulnerability influences stock and commodity market, which altogether decides price instability. The securities exchange is a basic stage in the money related arrangement of our nation as it assumes a major role in directing shortage area investment funds to the surplus part. The research examined the impact of certain macroeconomic factors (disposable revenues, interest rates, govt. policies, inflation and exchange rates) on the results of securities market performance in the National and Bombay stock exchanges. Thusly, the causal connection between the securities exchanges returns and chose macroeconomic factors in the NSE and BSE has been resolved in the investigation. The examination utilized the ADF, correlation, multiple regression and granger causality test for analyzing the association between the chose factors The study period was assessed by monthly data for 2006-2016. The findings showed that in the first difference the variables are stationary. There is a strong relationship exists between disposable income, government policies, the exchange rate and share price. This means that if these variables change, the stock prices of NSE and BSE will be affected. Furthermore, there is an unfavorable connection in the NSE and BSE between interest rate and inflation rate and share price, which means a shift in inflation and interest rate that will not have a strong impact on stock prices and will be in an adverse direction. In addition, a multiple regression that showed these variables was used to check the effect of selected macroeconomic factors on Indian stock prices.

A key factor that most investors in the construction sector consider in project selection is cost which has escalated over the years. Therefore, we examine the co-movements and causality in the time and frequency domains between the prime building cost index (PBCI) and its disaggregates on one hand and inflation and exchange rate on the other hand in Ghana. The findings revealed that the degree of co-movement between PBCI and inflation was significant at the 5% level and occurred over the long-run, indicating that construction cost drives inflation. The degree of co-movement between the prime build cost index and exchange rate occurred within the short term. These co-movements have policy implications for substituting inflation and exchange rates in project costing by investors in Ghana. The co-movement between the PBCI and inflation in the medium to higher frequencies suggests that inflation risk-averse investors should consider short-term projects. Again, the short to medium frequency co-movements between the PBCI and exchange rate indicates that investors should consider exchange rate risk in long-term projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rate; Frequency Domain; Ghana; Non-food Consumer Price Index; Prime Building Cost Index; Time Domain; Wavelet Analysis; Construction Industry; Cost Benefit Analysis; Costs; Information Services; Public Policy; Time Domain Analysis; Wavelet Analysis; Building Cost Indices; Consumer Price Index; Exchange Rates; Frequency Domains; Ghana; Time Domain; Frequency Domain Analysis; Building; Cost Analysis; Exchange Rate; Inflation; Macroeconomics; Wavelet Analysis","Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Information services; Public policy; Time domain analysis; Wavelet analysis; Building cost indices; Consumer price index; Exchange rates; Frequency domains; Ghana; Time domain; Frequency domain analysis; building; cost analysis; exchange rate; inflation; macroeconomics; wavelet analysis","","","","Abdullah, Ahmad Monir, The impact of crude oil price on Islamic stock indices of South East Asian countries: Evidence from MGARCH-DCC and wavelet approaches, Borsa Istanbul Review, 16, 4, pp. 219-232, (2016); undefined, (2014); Journal of Science and Technology, (2010); Akintoye, Akintola S., Analysis of factors influencing project cost estimating practice, Construction Management and Economics, 18, 1, pp. 77-89, (2000); Akintoye, Akintola S., Macro-economic leading indicators of construction contract prices, Construction Management and Economics, 16, 2, pp. 159-175, (1998); Building Estimating Manual for West Africa, (1996); Andrieş, Alin Marius, Comovement of Exchange Rates: A Wavelet Analysis, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 52, 3, pp. 574-588, (2016); Ashuri, Baabak, Time series analysis of ENR construction cost index, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 136, 11, pp. 1227-1237, (2010); Cost Studies of Buildings, (1999); Bekiros, Stelios D., On the time scale behavior of equity-commodity links: Implications for portfolio management, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 41, pp. 30-46, (2016)","","Routledge info@tandf.co.uk","","","","","","01446193; 1466433X","","CMECF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055325224"

In addition, stock prices significantly lead industrial production in four of the sampled countries and these relationships were positive as well.

Using both Kospi and Nikkei 225 as proxy for stock market performance, we designed a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) which integrates the econometric model in the short- and long-run. We found that the Korean and Japanese stock market reflects both macroeconomic variables and commodity prices on stock price indices. Our results reveal that each stock market index, GDP growth, inflation rate, interest rate, exchange rate, crude oil WTI price, and gold price perform a cointegration in the long-term, suggesting that Kospi and Nikkei 225 are corrected in -19.6% and -39.6% in each quarter, respectively. In addition, GDP growth, interest rate, exchange rate, oil price, and gold price affect the Kospi short-run performance, while GDP growth, interest rate, and gold price affect Nikkei 225 in the short-term. Using impulse-response function and the variance decomposition, we identified that the most significant impulse on each stock market index is its own shock, and its magnitude declines from the short- to the long-run. Our results are mostly consistent with the experience of other countries, especially Turkey and India, meaning the stock market index has been particularly affected by its own past prices. Our paper complements the literature of corporate finance by comparing the determinants of stock market performance of two Asian countries, including different robustness tests to explain the effect on Kospi and Nikkei 225 of each independent variable. For future research, the authors suggest to include a dummy variable for structural changes to increase the power of the model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commodity Prices; Macroeconomic Variables; Stock Market Performance; Vector Error Correction Model (vecm)","","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Kumoh Institute of Technology (2019-104-095).; Funding text 2: This research was supported by Kumoh National Institute of Technology (2019-104-095).","European Scientific Journal, (2014); Başci, Eşref Savaş, The determinants of stock market index: VAR approach to Turkish stock market, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 3, 1, pp. 163-171, (2013); Beck, Thorsten, Stock markets, banks, and growth: Panel evidence, Journal of Banking and Finance, 28, 3, pp. 423-442, (2004); International Business and Economics Research Journal, (2008); Bjørnland, Hilde Christiane, Oil price shocks and stock market booms in an oil exporting country, Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 56, 2, pp. 232-254, (2009); Boylan, Daniel H., A review of the effects of sarbanes-oxley on stock price, Global Business and Finance Review, 20, 1, pp. 121-126, (2015); Cheung, Yin-Wong, International evidence on the stock market and aggregate economic activity, Journal of Empirical Finance, 5, 3, pp. 281-296, (1998); Dassanayake, Wajira, Determinants of stock market index movements: Evidence from New Zealand stock market, pp. 6-11, (2017); Dimson, Elroy, Triumph of the optimists: 101 years of global investment returns, pp. 1-339, (2009); Econometrica, (1987)","","People and Global Business Association pngba@pngba.org","","","","","","23841648; 10886931","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078429325"

The study uses quarterly panel data of 39 automakers quoted on the stock exchanges in the 11 countries. It studies the effects of 19 macroeconomic variables from January 2000 to December 2017, and proposes the mixed-effect model constructed based on employing genetic algorithm and AIC criterion, and compares its explanatory power with the existing multifactor model (El Khoury, 2015). This paper suggests that the proposed model can shed more light on explaining the variability of stock prices of the quoted automakers. The findings show there are positive linkages between automaker's stock return volatility and explanatory variables such as stock market development, GDP and unemployment. Conversely, an inverse linkage between the dependent variable and money supply and IPI was found. The study demonstrates that selected macroeconomic factors can also be used as predictors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auto Industry; C33; C52; E44; G15; Genetic Algorithm; L62; Macroeconomic Variables; Mixed Effect Model; Multifactor Model; Stock Volatility; Automobile Industry; Empirical Analysis; Genetic Algorithm; Macroeconomics; Numerical Model; Stock Market","automobile industry; empirical analysis; genetic algorithm; macroeconomics; numerical model; stock market","","","The authors are thankful for the financial support received from the Czech Science Foundation, Grant No. 16-25536S: Methodology of Developing a Predictive Model of Sector and Company Performance in the Macroeconomic Context.","International Journal of Applied Econometrics and Quantitative Studies, (2004); Atsalakis, George S., Surveying stock market forecasting techniques - Part II: Soft computing methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3 PART 2, pp. 5932-5941, (2009); Balcombe, Kelvin G., Model slection using information criteria and genetic algorithms, Computational Economics, 25, 3, pp. 207-228, (2005); Bilson, Christopher M., Selecting macroeconomic variables as explanatory factors of emerging stock market returns, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 9, 4, pp. 401-426, (2001); Studies in the Theory of Capital Markets, (1972); Bodie, Zvi, COMMON STOCKS AS A HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION, Journal of Finance, 31, 2, pp. 459-470, (1976); Campbell, John Y., By force of habit: A consumption-based explanation of aggregate stock market behavior, Journal of Political Economy, 107, 2, pp. 205-251, (1999); Journal of Business, (1986); Cheung, Yin-Wong, International evidence on the stock market and aggregate economic activity, Journal of Empirical Finance, 5, 3, pp. 281-296, (1998); Connor, Gregory, A Test for the Number of Factors in an Approximate Factor Model, Journal of Finance, 48, 4, pp. 1263-1291, (1993)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","1331677X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073055207"

The Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA)-based exact maximum likelihood estimation was employed to determine the integration orders of the individual variables as well as the cointegrating residuals. Results from the ARFIMA model indicate that the month-on-month inflation rate, year-on-year inflation rate and stock market returns have non-integer orders of integration. This is inconsistent with the stationary/nonstationary results often obtained from the conventional unit root tests and implies that any shocks to the variables are highly persistent but eventually disappear. The results also reveal that the cointegrating residuals have non-integer orders of integration, suggesting that deviations from the long run equilibrium are prolonged, contrary to the assumption held under the conventional cointegration framework. The Fractionally Integrated Error Correction Model (FIECM) reveals that the year-on-year inflation rate positively granger causes stock market returns. This supports Fisher Effect and implies that stock market returns in Kenya provide shelter against inflationary pressures.

First, the authors analyze the risk characteristics for 11 Relative Value hedge fund strategies. Second, the authors introduce 3 families of behavioral factors, the D family, the L family, and the R family. In contrast to previous hedge fund studies, these new factors assume investors use historical and behavioral data such as average drawdown, run up, and liquidity from each hedge fund category to assess the risk. Third, additional macroeconomic variables, such as the CRB, Copper, and Oil are found to be statistically significant in some strategies. This economic and historical information, when included with asset pricing models, is more powerful in explaining hedge fund returns than previous models. Fourth, unlike the previous literature, these generated models are corrected for time-series assumptions violations and heteroskedasticity. To more fully understand the timing of risks and returns associated with investing in relative value hedge funds, pension funds and other investors should incorporate more economic factors and behavioral factors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Factor Models; Hedge Fund; Macroeconomic Indicators; Relative Value; Risk Factors","","","","The authors would like to thank Kenneth Ahern, Mikhail Chernov, Mike Cooper, Harry DeAngelo, Wayne Ferson, Gerard Hoberg, and Gordon Philips for their insightful comments and suggestions.

The yield of Shibor market from 2006 to 2016 showed anti-persistence, and the later five-year trend was stronger than that in the previous half period, indicating a significantly growing trend of China's interest rate market. We perform a comparative analysis of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), detrending moving average (DMA) algorithm, and the maximum overlap wavelet transform (DFA-MODWT) using grey and original sequences. The autoregressive integrated moving average model is adopted to generate set-point H sequences. Results illustrated that 1) for original sequences, both the DFA-MODWT and DMA (θ=0.5) shows outstanding performances when the set Hurst exponents are 0.6 and 0.7 and 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. 2) For grey sequences, G-DFA performs best among the three methods, followed by G-DMA and G-DFA-MODWT. 3) The long-range correlation of the original sequences is slightly lower than the set values. On the contrary, the long-range correlation of grey sequences is much higher than the set values. Thus, the grey sequence exerts a strong aggregation effect as it can accumulate the trend of the sequence. Our results show that the grey sequence can determine the regular pattern from the messy sequence. However, grey sequences tend to be overly analyzed and misleading when large volumes of data are involved. Empirical studies confirm that China's interest rate market remains an inefficient market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Detrended Fluctuation Analysis; Grey System Theory; Interest Rate Market; Long-range Correlation; Shibor; System Theory; Wavelet Transforms; Detrended Fluctuation Analysis; Grey System Theory; Interest Rates; Long Range Correlations; Shibor; Commerce","System theory; Wavelet transforms; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Grey system theory; Interest rates; Long range correlations; Shibor; Commerce","","","We thank for the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71371100 ), Major Program of the Philosophy and Social Science Fund of Education Department of Jiangsu Province, China (No. 2017ZDAXM005 ), and Major Program of National Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China (No. 16ZDA054 ).

The effect of crude oil supply security and price impact cannot be ignored. As the world’s largest oil importer, China is highly dependent on foreign oil. Therefore, the fluctuation of international oil prices may impact the development of China’s various industries in a significant and differential way. However, because the available data have different frequencies, much of the recent research that addresses the effect of oil prices on industry development need to replace, split, or merge the original data, resulting in loss of the information from the original data. Using the mixed data sampling model (MIDAS(m,K,h)-AR(1)) with the first-order lag autoregressive terms of the interpreted variables, this study builds a mixed data model to investigate the effect of oil price volatility on the output of China's industries. This study expands the extant research by financial market fluctuations and macroeconomic analysis, and at the same time makes short-term predictions on the output of China’s seven main industries. The analysis results show that the mixed data regression model brings the original information contained in different frequency data into the model analysis, and utilizes the latest high frequency data of the explanatory variables to perform real-time short-term prediction of low-frequency interpreted variables. This method improves the timeliness of forecasting macroeconomic indicators and the accuracy of short-term forecasts. The empirical results show that the spot price of international crude oil has a significant and differential impact on the outputs of the seven industries in China. Among them, oil price fluctuation has the greatest impact on the output of China’s financial industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","International Oil Prices; Macroeconomic Variables; Midas; Costs; Crude Oil; Economics; Forecasting; Regression Analysis; Explanatory Variables; Financial Market Fluctuations; Macro-economic Analysis; Macroeconomic Indicators; Macroeconomic Variables; Midas; Oil Prices; Short Term Prediction; Petroleum Analysis","Costs; Crude oil; Economics; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Explanatory variables; Financial market fluctuations; Macro-economic analysis; Macroeconomic indicators; Macroeconomic variables; MIDAS; Oil Prices; Short term prediction; Petroleum analysis","","","Acknowledgments: This research was partially supported by Yunxiao Ye and Liang Ting (Graduate student at Shaanxi Normal University).

Over the years, prices of equity have been volatile, quite unpredictable and bearish in nature. Individual investors might be worse off by making inappropriate decisions consequent upon the unpredictability of the movements of stock fundamentals in the Nigerian Capital Market. Despite the fluctuation in the stock prices in the market, the engagements of appropriate stock fundamentals by the investors could guarantee positive returns in the market. Data was collected through secondary data apparatus. Panel data from thirty four (34) quoted firms on the floor of Nigerian stock market were obtained from the financial statements and Central Bank of Nigerian Fact Books from 1990 to 2016. In the study, the methods employed were Descriptive Statistics and Pooled Ordinary Least Square. The model measured both the Fixed and Random Effects of the variables, however, the Hausman test of 39.78 with p-value of 0.0000 is significant at 5% level, thus the coefficients of Fixed Effect (FE) models are recommended for prediction of stock prices in the NSE. To make choice of stocks to be included in a portfolio in the NSE, it is recommended that investors should engage Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Capital Gains (cag) to choose return driven stocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dividend Per Share; Earnings Per Share; Equity; Positive Returns; Price Earnings Ratio; Stock Fundamentals; Commerce; Costs; Earnings; Information Management; Investments; Least Squares Approximations; Random Processes; Dividend Per Share; Earnings Per Share; Equity; Positive Returns; Price Earnings Ratio; Stock Fundamentals; Financial Markets","Commerce; Costs; Earnings; Information management; Investments; Least squares approximations; Random processes; Dividend Per Share; Earnings per share; Equity; Positive Returns; Price Earnings Ratio; Stock Fundamentals; Financial markets","","","","Mpra Paper, (2008); Ikpefan, Ochei Ailemen, Deregulation of foreign exchange market and its effect on industrial produce in Nigeria, Asian Journal of Information Technology, 15, 13, pp. 2101-2107, (2016); African Journal of Business Management, (2009); Financial Management, (1999); Lahore Journal of Economics, (2009); Journal of Accounting Research, (1968); Barrows, Clayton W., Use of macroeconomic variables to evaluate selected hospitality stock returns in the U.S., International Journal of Hospitality Management, 13, 2, pp. 119-128, (1994); Economic Review Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, (1997); Chamberlain, Gary E., Asymptotic efficiency in estimation with conditional moment restrictions, Journal of Econometrics, 34, 3, pp. 305-334, (1987); Valuation of Equity Shares in India, (1978)","Soliman, K.S.","International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA admin@ibima.org","","32nd International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2018","","Seville","145733","","9780999855119","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063049794"

The data is restricted to the period for which monthly data are available from January 1986 to October 2016 (370 observations) retrieved from the Economic Statistics System database sponsored by the Bank of Korea. The study employs unit root test, cointegration test, vector error correction estimates, impulse response test, and structural break test. The results of the Johansen cointegration test indicate at least three cointegrating equations exist at the 0.05 level in the model, confirming that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic variables in Korea. The results of vector error correction model (VECM) estimates indicate that money supply and short-term interest rate are not related to stock prices in the short-run. However, exchange rate is positively related to stock prices while the industrial production index and inflation are negatively related to stock prices in the short-run. Furthermore, the VECM estimates indicate that the external shock, such as regional and global financial crisis shocks, neither affects changes in the endogenous variables nor causes instability in the cointegrating vector. This study finds that the endogenous variables are determined by their own dynamics in the model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rate; Global Financial Crisis; Korea; Macroeconomic Variables; Stock Prices","","","","","J Manag Res, (2008); African Journal of Business Management, (2012); European Scientific Journal, (2014); Journal of Financial Studies Research, (2016); Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen, On the relation between stock prices and exchange rates: a review article, Journal of Economic Studies, 42, 4, pp. 707-732, (2015); Basistha, Arabinda, Macroeconomic cycles and the stock market's reaction to monetary policy, Journal of Banking and Finance, 32, 12, pp. 2606-2616, (2008); Bilson, Christopher M., Selecting macroeconomic variables as explanatory factors of emerging stock market returns, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 9, 4, pp. 401-426, (2001); Bjørnland, Hilde Christiane, Identifying the interdependence between US monetary policy and the stock market, Journal of Monetary Economics, 56, 2, pp. 275-282, (2009); Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, (2007); Brahmasrene, Tantatape, Crude oil prices and exchange rates: Causality, variance decomposition and impulse response, Energy Economics, 44, pp. 407-412, (2014)","","Korea Distribution Science Association (KODISA) kodisajournals@gmail.com","","","","","","22884645; 22884637","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054713318"

The interdependencies between markets are stronger during turbulent times on financial markets than during periods of calm. This fact was especially evident during the global crisis. So, the predictability of stock return interrelationships is a topic discussed most-frequently in empirical studies. In this paper, the role of macroeconomics indicators in the dynamic of interrelationships between financial markets will be considered. Effects of the unemployment rate, CPI, long-term interest rate, and industrial production on the comovement between markets from the G6 group will be verified. For this purpose, the Markov-switching copula model with time-varying matrix transition probability (TVPMS) will be adapted. It has been found that the unemployment rate and long-term interest rate are important factors for interrelationships between the Polish market and the developed market from Germany, France or Italy. The long-term interest rate appears to be important for interrelationships between the Poland and British market and between some developed markets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Markets; G6; Interrelations; Macroeconomic Indicators; Tvtmp Model","","","","","Ang, Andrew, International Asset Allocation With Regime Shifts, Review of Financial Studies, 15, 4, pp. 1137-1187, (2002); Barbić, Tajana, Relationship between macroeconomic fundamentals and stock market indices in selected CEE countries, Ekonomski Pregled, 62, 3-4, pp. 113-133, (2011); Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31, 3, pp. 307-327, (1986); Regime Switches in the Volatility and Correlation of Financial Institutions, (2012); Journal of International Business and Economics, (2005); Chang, Kuangliang, Do macroeconomic variables have regime-dependent effects on stock return dynamics?

Existing literature concentrates on the impact of venture capital on firm-level performance. Unlike much of the earlier work, we conduct a macro study examining short-term and long-term relationships between VC investment, the state of the financial sector, and economic growth in 20 European single market countries between 1989 and 2015. We show that major transformations (political, economic, financial and institutional) over the sample period in the Eurozone region have resulted in the data series used in the study (economic growth, financial sector development, and VC investment) to be non-stationary. As such, the vector error-correction model (VECM) and Granger-Causality test are used to examine short-term and long-term relationships between VC investment, financial development, and economic growth for the sample countries. The findings suggest that economic growth strategies and financial sector reforms are critical for a vibrant venture capital industry. In the short term, there are bi-directional relationships between some of the variables. These results suggest that plans to create a vibrant venture capital industry will reinforce financial sector development and economic development, creating a more sustainable economic development model for countries in the Eurozone region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Growth; European Single Market Countries; Financial Development; Venture Capital Investment","","","","","Amit, Raphael, Why do venture capital firms exist? theory and canadian evidence, Journal of Business Venturing, 13, 6, pp. 441-466, (1998); Pakistan Economic and Social Review, (2014); Private Capital Flows Financial Development and Economic Growth in Developing Countries, (2000); Financial Management, (1994); Barry, Christopher B., Debt financing, venture capital, and the performance of initial public offerings, Journal of Banking and Finance, 58, pp. 144-165, (2015); Beck, Thorsten, Financial and legal constraints to growth: Does firm size matter?, Journal of Finance, 60, 1, pp. 137-177, (2005); Berger, Allen N., Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, Bank Relationship Strength, and the Use of Venture Capital, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 43, 2-3, pp. 461-490, (2011); Black, Bernard S., Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: Banks versus stock markets, Journal of Financial Economics, 47, 3, pp. 243-277, (1998); Bonini, Stefano, The political and legal determinants of venture capital investments around the world, Small Business Economics, 39, 4, pp. 997-1016, (2012); Bottazzi, Laura, Venture capital in Europe and the financing of innovative companies, Economic Policy, 34, pp. 229-270, (2002)","","Routledge info@tandf.co.uk","","","","","","14645343; 13691066","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020207445"

The results identify mitigating factors in MENA's finance–growth relationships. Moreover, they show that the impact of finance on growth was positive pre-Arab Spring, but lost some of its significance post the Arab Spring, as some macroeconomic indicators improved, while others worsened.

These findings suggest that the financial development–growth nexus is contingent on socio-political reforms that shift the paradigm of institutional quality.

Month-to-month data from the KSE 100 index and monetary variables were extracted for the period January 1992 to November 2015. We transformed the data series into a stationary form by employing the augmented Dickey– Fuller method. The Johansen cointegration approach reinforces the long-haul association between equity prices and monetary indicators, for instance the rate of exchange, inflation, and interest rates. Results of the Granger and Toda and Yamamoto causalities demonstrate the unidirectional causal relationship between interest rate and KSE 100 index; the one-way causation existed from interest rate to equity returns for the KSE100 index. The analysis of the impulse response function concludes that the changes in the KSE 100 index happened due to its own shocks. However, changes in exchange and inflation rates were experienced because of the interest rate. The outcome of variance decomposition demonstrated that most of the changes in the KSE 100 index are because of its own shocks. Thus, it is concluded that the predictability of the equity prices for the KSE 100 heavily relied on exchange rate, inflation, and interest rate variations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Granger Causality; Johansen Cointegration; Kse 100 Index; Macroeconomic Variables; Toda And Yamamoto Causality; Variance Decomposition; Cointegration Analysis; Decomposition Analysis; Development Indicator; Exchange Rate; Granger Causality Test; Inflation; Interest Rate; Macroeconomics; Multivariate Analysis; Variance Analysis","cointegration analysis; decomposition analysis; development indicator; exchange rate; Granger causality test; inflation; interest rate; macroeconomics; multivariate analysis; variance analysis","","","","Abdalla, Issam S.A., Exchange rate and stock price interactions in emerging financial markets: Evidence on India, Korea, Pakistan and the Philippines, Applied Financial Economics, 7, 1, pp. 25-35, (1997); Abounoori, Esmaiel, Forecasting Tehran stock exchange volatility; Markov switching GARCH approach, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 445, pp. 264-282, (2016); Stock Market Returns and Macroeconomic Factors, (2002); Macroeconomic Factors and Stock Market Movement Evidence from Ghana, (2008); Akron Business and Economic Review, (1981); Journal of Business Review, (2013); Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2012); Raheem Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem, An empirical analysis of causal relationship between stock prices and real sector of the Pakistani economy, pp. 337-345, (2015); Akaike, Hirotsugu, Fitting autoregressive models for prediction, Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 21, 1, pp. 243-247, (1969); Second International Symposium on Information Theory, (1973)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","1331677X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022218076"

We associate Markov switching regime 1 with economic upturn and regime 2 with economic downturn. We find clear evidence of cyclical variations in the three premiums, most notable being that in the size premium, which changes from positive in expansions to negative in recessions. Macroeconomic indicators prompting such cyclicality the most are variables that proxy credit market conditions, namely the interest rates, term structure and credit spread. Overall, macro factors tend to have more significant impact on the three premiums during economic downturns. The results are robust to the choice of information variable used in modelling transition probabilities of the two-stage Markov switching model. We show that exploiting cyclicality in premiums proves particularly profitable for portfolios featuring small cap stocks in recessions at a feasible level of transaction costs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyclicality; Macroeconomic Determinants; Size; Two-state Markov Switching Model; Value And Momentum Premiums; Economic Analysis; Economic Structure; Interest Rate; Macroeconomics; Markov Chain; Modeling; United Kingdom","economic analysis; economic structure; interest rate; macroeconomics; Markov chain; modeling; United Kingdom","","","","Ammann, Manuel, The effect of market regimes on style allocation, Financial Markets and Portfolio Management, 20, 3, pp. 309-337, (2006); Market Timing Models Constructing Implementing and Optimising A Market Timing Based Investment Strategies, (1997); Kevin Aretz, Kevin, Macroeconomic risks and characteristic-based factor models, Journal of Banking and Finance, 34, 6, pp. 1383-1399, (2010); Journal of Investing, (2004); Working Paper Ssrn, (2016); Barberis, Nicholas C., Chapter 18 A survey of behavioral finance, Handbook of the Economics of Finance, 1, SUPPL.

Empirically, previous studies have measured the impact of crude oil price (COP) volatility on stock market performance. However, limited studies exist for Nigeria and other oil exporting countries. Thus, this study seeks to fill the gap in existing literature by establishing the nexus between oil price, EXR and stock market performance in Nigeria. Using the ordinary least square estimation technique, the basic variables adopted in this study are all share index (ASI) which serves as a proxy for market performance, COP and EXR. Annual time series data covering the period of 1985-2014 was used to estimate the model using regression analysis. Based on the Trace statistics result, there exists one co-integrating relationship among ASI, COP, and EXR. The R2 = 0.505; showing that 50.5% of the variation in stock market performance can be explained by COPs and EXR. The F-statistic value of 2.17 (P < 0.05) shows that ASI, COPs and EXR are jointly significant and the Durbin-Watson value of 2.22 implies that the model does not suffer from autocorrelation. Also, based on the P-values, COPs was found to be insignificant, which means that fluctuations in oil prices do not directly affect the performance of the stock market. In conclusion, COPs and EXR does impact ASI. It is therefore recommended that the Nigerian government should take steps to ensure that Oil companies in Nigeria are listed on the stock market, to have more direct impact on the economy. The novelty of this study is the ability to tell the relationship between COPs and the Nigerian stock exchange. This study will guide government in formulating policies relating to the petroleum industry considering the impact their decisions will have on the economy if the oil companies are listed in the stock market. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rates; Oil Price; Stock Market; Volatility","","","","","Abdalla, Suliman Zakaria Suliman, Modelling stock returns volatility: Empirical evidence from saudi stock exchange, International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 85, pp. 166-179, (2012); Topics in Middle Eastern and African Economies, (2008); Aleisa, Eisa A., Sources of real exchange rate movements in Saudi Arabia, Journal of Economics and Finance, 26, 1, pp. 101-110, (2002); Hedi Arouri, Mohamed El, Oil prices, stock markets and portfolio investment: Evidence from sector analysis in Europe over the last decade, Energy Policy, 38, 8, pp. 4528-4539, (2010); Arabian Journal of Business and Management Review, (2012); Operational Research an International Journal, (2006); Bjørnland, Hilde Christiane, Monetary policy and exchange rate interactions in a small open economy, Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 110, 1, pp. 197-221, (2008); Cheung, Yin-Wong, International evidence on the stock market and aggregate economic activity, Journal of Empirical Finance, 5, 3, pp. 281-296, (1998); Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, (2001); Cong, Ronggang, Relationships between oil price shocks and stock market: An empirical analysis from China, Energy Policy, 36, 9, pp. 3544-3553, (2008)","","Econjournals ijeep@econjournals.com","","","","","","21464553","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038097137"

Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to explore the level relationship between the macroeconomic variables and SCDS spreads. The error correction model is estimated to examine the short-run effects of the underlying macroeconomic variables on SCDS spreads. Finally, the long-run estimates are obtained in the ARDL framework. The study uses monthly data covering the period January 2001-February 2015. Findings: The results indicate that there is a significant long-run relationship between the macroeconomic indicators and SCDS spreads. The estimated long-run coefficients reveal that both the interest rate and foreign exchange reserves are significantly and negatively, whereas imports and the rate of inflation are positively related to SCDS spreads. Yet, the results suggest that the exchange rate and exports do not have any significant long-run impact on SCDS spreads. The findings regarding the short-run relationship indicate that the exchange rate, imports and the rate of inflation are positively, whereas the interest rate and exports are negatively related to SCDS spreads. Practical implications: The results suggest that State Bank of Pakistan should design monetary and foreign exchange rate polices to minimize unwanted variations in the exchange rate to reduce SCDS spreads. The results also suggest that it is incumbent to Pakistan Government to improve the balance of payments to reduce SCDS spreads. The findings also suggest that the inflation targeting policy can also help in reducing SCDS spreads. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the empirical determinants of SCDS spreads for Pakistan. Second, it estimates the short- and long-run effects in the ARDL framework. Third, it considers both internal and external empirical determinants of SCDS spreads. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rates; Exports And Imports; Foreign Reserves; Inflation; Interest Rates; Sovereign Credit Default Swap","","","","","Afonso, António, Understanding the determinants of sovereign debt ratings: Evidence for the two leading agencies, Journal of Economics and Finance, 27, 1, pp. 56-74, (2003); Aktug, Rahmi Erdem, The dynamics of sovereign credit default swap and bond markets: Empirical evidence from the 2001 to 2007 period, Applied Economics Letters, 19, 3, pp. 251-259, (2012); Aizenman, Joshua, What is the risk of European sovereign debt defaults?

The long-run influence of oil price on the Nigerian macroeconomic environment is found to be stronger than the short-run effect with all the indicators of the macroeconomic environment (exchange rate, inflation rate and broad money supply) responding significantly to oil price in the long-run. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ardl-bounds Testing Approach; Broad Money (m2) Supply; Exchange Rate; Inflation Rate; Macroeconomic Environment; Nigerian Stock Market; Oil Price","","","","","Abbas, Ghulam, Interaction among stock prices and monetary variables in Pakistan, International Journal of Monetary Economics and Finance, 7, 1, pp. 13-27, (2014); Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics, (1993); Abouwafia, Hashem E., Monetary policy, exchange rates and stock prices in the Middle East region, International Review of Financial Analysis, 37, pp. 14-28, (2015); Paul Alagidede, Imhotep, Modelling stock returns in Africa's emerging equity markets, International Review of Financial Analysis, 18, 1-2, pp. 1-11, (2009); Antoniou, Antonios, Macroeconomic variables as common pervasive risk factors and the empirical content of the arbitrage pricing theory, Journal of Empirical Finance, 5, 3, pp. 221-240, (1998); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Causal relationships between oil and stock prices: Some new wvidence from gule oil-exporting countries, Economie Internationale, 122, 2, pp. 41-56, (2010); Babatunde, Musibau Adetunji, Oil price shocks and stock market behaviour in Nigeria, Journal of Economic Studies, 40, 2, pp. 180-202, (2013); Bekhet, Hussain Ali, Co-integration and causality analysis between stock market prices and their determinates in Jordan, Economic Modelling, 35, pp. 508-514, (2013); Journal of Business, (1986); Cheng, Arnold Cheuk Sang, THE UK STOCK MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS: A NEW APPROACH, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 22, 1, pp. 129-142, (1995)","","Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","","","","","","17520487; 17520479","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019688131"

The main aim of this research is to identify longterm interdependences among Austrian, Czech, Hungarian and Polish capital markets and the market of Germany. Additionally, the impact of short-term shocks on these markets is under evaluation. In the first step of the research the interdependencies among the capital markets in the years 1997-2015 were verified. For this purpose the DCC-GARCH model with the conditional t-distribution was used. In the second step, an analysis of cointegration for the interdependencies among the markets was carried out. The authors proposed to include conditional variances of the analysed markets as additional explanatory variables in the cointegration analysis. As the conditional variance most often reflects the impact of short-term shocks, the proposed approach allowed to take into account shortterm market shocks in the cointegration analysis. The results enabled to identify long-term path for the course of the interdependences among markets of Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. The mentioned Central European capital markets make a group of markets characterized with similar long-term path, which are focused around the dominant market of Germany. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cointegration Analysis; Conditional Correlation; Conditional Variance; Dcc-garch Model; Short-term Shocks","","","","","Andersen, Torben G., Forecasting financial market volatility: Sample frequency vis-à-vis forecast horizon, Journal of Empirical Finance, 6, 5, pp. 457-477, (1999); Arshanapalli, Bala G., Pre and post-October 1987 stock market linkages between U.S. and Asian markets, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 3, 1, pp. 57-73, (1995); Avdoulas, Christos, Detecting nonlinear dependencies in eurozone peripheral equity markets: A multistep filtering approach, Economic Modelling, 58, pp. 580-587, (2016); Baek, Inmee, Testing contagion of the 1997-98 crisis in Asian stock markets with structural breaks and incubation periods, Journal of Asian Economics, 22, 5, pp. 356-368, (2011); Ekonomista, (2009); Montenegrin Journal of Economics, (2016); Balcerzak, Adam P., Fiscal burden in the European union member states, Economic Annals-XXI, 161, 9-10, pp. 4-6, (2016); Managing and Modeling Financial Risks 8th International Scientific Conference Proceedings Part I, (2016); 10th Professor Aleksander Zelias International Conference on Modelling and Forecasting of Socio Economic Phenomena, (2016); Chapters, (2016)","","Centre of Sociological Research office@csr.co.ua","","","","","","2071789X; 23063459","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017336756"

Earlier studies show that integrated stock markets exhibit immediate reaction to international macroeconomic news, whereas partially integrated or segmented markets mostly do not react to such announcements. This paper investigates the effect of surprises disguised in the macroeconomic announcements made by the European Monetary Union on CIVETS (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, and South Africa) stock markets. Daily stock market data starting from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012 is analysed. The impact of macroeconomic announcements is estimated by using EGARCH model. The results show that the returns of four out of six CIVETS stock markets significantly react on the day of macroeconomic announcements, whereas the market volatility of all markets is affected due to the EMU’s announcements. The results also show that not all types of announcements have significant impact on returns and volatilities in CIVETS, highlighting the importance of the contents of macroeconomic surprises. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Civets; Emerging Markets; Integration; Macroeconomic Announcements; Spillovers","","","","","Andersen, Torben G., Real-time price discovery in global stock, bond and foreign exchange markets, Journal of International Economics, 73, 2, pp. 251-277, (2007); Balduzzi, Pierluigi, Economic news and bond prices: Evidence from the U.S. Treasury market, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 36, 4, pp. 523-543, (2001); Bekaert, Geert, Time‐Varying World Market Integration, Journal of Finance, 50, 2, pp. 403-444, (1995); Bollerslev, Tim, Intraday periodicity, long memory volatility, and macroeconomic announcement effects in the US Treasury bond market, Journal of Empirical Finance, 7, 1, pp. 37-55, (2000); Introductory Econometrics for Finance, (2002); Icfai Journal of Applied Finance, (2008); Engle, Robert F., Multivariate simultaneous generalized arch, Econometric Theory, 11, 1, pp. 122-150, (1995); Fedorova, Elena, Global and local sources of risk in Eastern European emerging stock markets, Finance a Uver - Czech Journal of Economics and Finance, 59, 1, pp. 2-19, (2009); Francis, Bill B., Dynamic relations between international equity and currency markets: The role of currency order flow, Journal of Business, 79, 1, pp. 219-257, (2006); Graham, Michael A., Relative importance of scheduled macroeconomic news for stock market investors, Journal of Economics and Finance, 27, 2, pp. 153-165, (2003)","","University of Economics - Prague","","","","","","12100455; 2336730X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014619495"

(2) What have been the macroeconomic indicators of UK banking instability? and (3) What have been the consequences of UK banking instability for the cost of credit? Using a unique dataset of bank share prices from 1830 to 2010 to assess the stability of the UK banking system, we find that banking instability has grown more severe since the 1970s. We also find that interest rates, inflation, lending growth, and equity prices are consistent macroeconomic indicators of UK banking instability over the long run. Furthermore, utilising a unique dataset of corporate-bond yields for the period 1860 to 2010, we find that there is a significant long-run relationship between banking instability and the credit-risk premium faced by businesses. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Crises; Cost Of Credit; Financial Instability","","","","We are grateful to two anonymous referees for valuable comments.

The purpose of this paper is to study lead/lag interactions between workers' remittance outflows and macroeconomic leading variables in Saudi Arabia for 1980–2013 within a time–frequency framework. To this end, we perform three wavelet variants, namely, the wavelet power spectrum, the cross-spectrum wavelet, and the coherence wavelet. We show that remittance outflows are strongly associated with the main Saudi aggregates and that their relationships change across time scale and frequency bands. In the short- and mid-term, real output growth and government expenditures guide remittance outflows. More specifically, government expenditures positively affect remittance shares to real outputs. In addition, the wavelet analysis reveals a positive causality link from the active population to remittances over low-frequency bands. These outcomes have several prominent implications and point to practical recommendations in terms of monetary policy coordination and financial stability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Growth; Government Expenditures; Wavelets; Workers' Remittances","","","","The authors would like to thank the Co-Editor Prof. P.

Using quantile regression approach, we investigate the co-movement and the dependence structure between DJIMI returns and influential global financial market conditions, macroeconomic indicators and risk factors (major conventional stock market indices returns, global stock market uncertainty (VIX), crude oil prices, inflation rates, slope of the yield curves, investor sentiment indicator, and global sovereign credit risk represented by sovereign credit default swap (CDS) premiums). The empirical results demonstrate that conventional stock market returns, stock market implied volatility and the slope of the yield curve (as a proxy for future economic conditions) are significant for all the quantiles and display asymmetric tail dependence. During and after the global financial crisis, the sovereign credit risk factor has also been significant with positive coefficients, implying the impact of systemic nature of sovereign credit risk on explaining DJIMI returns.

The stock prices volatility is partly explained by volatility in exchange rates. We adopt an asymmetric power ARCH (APARCH) model which takes into account long memory behaviour, speed of market information, asymmetries and leverage effects. For BSE Sensex, NIFTY and JPY/INR there is an asymmetric response of volatilities to positive and negative shocks and negative correlation exists between returns and volatility and thus bad news will create greater volatility. However, for USD/INR, Euro/INR and GBP/INR good news has greater effect on price volatility than the bad news.

The implications of whether information asymmetries occur on financial markets are important. From a trading perspective, excess information events can lead to efficiency biases and can also be associated with spikes in intraday volatility, as well as sharp modifications of intraday liquidity. The probability of informed trading (PIN) metric can provide a viable mean for noise traders in understanding rapid fluctuations in microstructure indicators, such as those indicated above. Even though PIN estimation has been covered in the academic literature from a microstructure vantage point, to our knowledge there are no studies assessing the relationship between macroeconomic variables and the PIN. We find that the exchange rate, the interest rate and the oil price are better suited than microstructure indicators to explain the PIN on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The current study brings insight into the dynamics of certain macroeconomic indicators and informational asymmetries on the Bucharest Stock Exchange.

This book provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock prices in India. A wide range of statistical models are used to estimate and interpret the relationships between Indian stock prices and eleven macroeconomic variables during the liberalized period. While the author finds that the Indian stock market is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals in the long run, in the short run only a few macroeconomic variables (such as consumer price index, foreign trade, and exchange rate) affect stock prices.

The farmers and the consumers generally disfavor the volatility in food markets and consider it as a serious concern; whereas the speculators favor such price fluctuations to profit by predicting which direction prices are headed. Generally such trading activity has an irrational component translated into prices. The unpredictability of food prices is a cause for concern because of the adverse effects it has on the producers as well as the consumers. The agricultural commodity prices all around the world have been substantially sensitive to the movements of macroeconomic indicators in this century. In India, the Dhaanya highlights the importance of agriculture and provides a reliable benchmark for the traded Agri-commodities. Today, the Investors all over the world consider Agri-commodities as one of the major asset class and the other indicators like Nifty market index and the Rupee Dollar (US) exchange rate have major influence on the prices of Dhaanya (Mahalakshmi, et.al., 2012 a, b & c).

Fuzzy models are a suitable tool as they offer the chance of working with both absolute and relative quantitative indicators. The main part of the creation of our model was the selection of key variables (macroeconomic indicators) determining the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) under the conditions of the Polish capital market between 2000 and 2013. The Polish primary capital market belongs currently to the most developed capital markets in Europe in terms of both the volume and value of IPOs. The knowledge base of the model is a set of statements. These statements describe real situations, in our case macroeconomic and capital market indicators characterizing the external conditions for IPOs. The weight of these conditional statements or variables determines the extent of the given statement's relevance. Our knowledge base includes 14 conditional statements. The outcome of our research is a model proposal which supports managers in decision making about the timing of going public. Choosing the right time of an IPO may help issuers to increase the probability of a successful subscription of new securities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Market; Fuzzy Modelling; Ipo; Macroeconomic Determinants; Poland; Commerce; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems; Economics; Financial Markets; Fuzzy Logic; Information Management; Knowledge Based Systems; Regional Planning; Sustainable Development; Decision Support Models; Fuzzy Modelling; Initial Public Offerings; Ipo; Macroeconomic Determinants; Macroeconomic Indicators; Poland; Quantitative Indicators; Electronic Trading","Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Financial markets; Fuzzy logic; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Decision support models; Fuzzy modelling; Initial public offerings; IPO; Macroeconomic determinants; Macroeconomic indicators; Poland; Quantitative indicators; Electronic trading","","","","Ameer, Rashid, Macroeconomic factors and initial public offerings (IPOs) in Malaysia, Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, 8, 1, pp. 41-67, (2012); Bistrova, Julia, The influence of capital structure on Baltic corporate performance, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 12, 4, pp. 655-669, (2011); On the Decision to Go Public Evidence from Privately Held Firms, (2004); Brau, James C., Initial public offerings: An analysis of theory and practice, Journal of Finance, 61, 1, pp. 399-436, (2006); Brau, James C., The Choice of IPO versus Takeover: Empirical Evidence, Journal of Business, 76, 4, pp. 583-612, (2003); Determinants of Initial Public Offerings A European Time Series Cross Section Analysis, (2002); Choe, Hyuk J., Common stock offerings across the business cycle.

Our sample includes only local enterprises that conducted an IPO on the Main Market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Financial and privatized companies are excluded from the data processing. The Spearman correlation analysis is used to identify the relations between the macroeconomic (external) determinants and the number of listings and the value of capital raised by IPOs. The data is evaluated at the significance level of α=5%. The data is processed in two ways. Firstly, dependent variables (X1.X4) and explanatory variables (Y1.Y5) are analysed simultaneously, next, the explanatory variables are lagged by one year. The findings of the simultaneously data analysis can be summarized as follows: A significant difference was found to exist between real GDP growth rates and the number of IPOs and between industrial production growth rates and the number of listings. GDP growth rates have also a significant positive influence on the value of capital raised by IPOs. In addition to that, there exists a statistically significant positive relationship between the industrial production growth rates and median IPO value. Surprisingly, there is just a little empirical evidence that a relationship between explanatory a dependent variables exists when the macroeconomic indicators are lagged by one year. Only the pattern of volatility of WIG index returns lead the median value of capital raised IPOs. The correlation coefficient between real GDP growth rates and median IPO value is even negative when we shift dependent variables relative to the explanatory variables by one year. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central And Eastern Europe (cee); External Determinants; Initial Public Offerings (ipos); Macroeconomic Factors; Poland; Commerce; Cybernetics; Data Handling; Information Science; Investments; Privatization; Central And Eastern Europe; External Determinants; Initial Public Offerings; Macroeconomic Factors; Poland; Growth Rate","Commerce; Cybernetics; Data handling; Information science; Investments; Privatization; Central and Eastern Europe; External Determinants; Initial public offerings; Macroeconomic Factors; Poland; Growth rate","","","","Ameer, Rashid, Macroeconomic factors and initial public offerings (IPOs) in Malaysia, Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, 8, 1, pp. 41-67, (2012); Bilson, Christopher M., Selecting macroeconomic variables as explanatory factors of emerging stock market returns, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 9, 4, pp. 401-426, (2001); Black, Bernard S., Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: Banks versus stock markets, Journal of Financial Economics, 47, 3, pp. 243-277, (1998); Brau, James C., Initial public offerings: An analysis of theory and practice, Journal of Finance, 61, 1, pp. 399-436, (2006); Determinants of Initial Public Offerings A European Time Series Cross Section Analysis, (2002); Qfinance, (2014); Chemmanur, Thomas J., A theory of the going-public decision, Review of Financial Studies, 12, 2, pp. 249-279, (1999); Choe, Hyuk J., Common stock offerings across the business cycle.

Our sample includes 218 local enterprises that conducted an IPO on the Main Market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Financial and privatized companies are excluded from the data processing. As follows from the previous studies, the situation in the year preceding the companys initial public offering is crucial. Therefore, we used a model with one-year delay for all the explanatory variables in relation to the dependent variable (i.e. number of new listing). The model estimation was performed with the Ordinary Least Squares method. The main conclusion of our model is that the GDP growth has a significant impact on the number of new issues. This result implies that the business cycle has a direct impact on the IPO activity in the Polish capital market. The next conclusion is that the attractiveness of a capital market for investors measured by annual index returns appears to be an important factor for going public activities. Surprisingly, the model could confirm that other macroeconomic and capital market factors have had no explanatory power for IPO numbers in Poland between 2004 and 2012. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Finance; Determinants; Going Public; Initial Public Offering (ipo); Poland","","","","","Ameer, Rashid, Macroeconomic factors and initial public offerings (IPOs) in Malaysia, Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, 8, 1, pp. 41-67, (2012); Multinational Finance Journal, (2000); Bilson, Christopher M., Selecting macroeconomic variables as explanatory factors of emerging stock market returns, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 9, 4, pp. 401-426, (2001); Black, Bernard S., Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: Banks versus stock markets, Journal of Financial Economics, 47, 3, pp. 243-277, (1998); Brau, James C., Initial public offerings: An analysis of theory and practice, Journal of Finance, 61, 1, pp. 399-436, (2006); Determinants of Initial Public Offerings A European Time Series Cross Section Analysis, (2002); Qfinance, (2014); Financial Reports, (2014); Chemmanur, Thomas J., A theory of the going-public decision, Review of Financial Studies, 12, 2, pp. 249-279, (1999); Choe, Hyuk J., Common stock offerings across the business cycle.

Notwithstanding the recent trend of the stock market development in emerging countries, some argue that Islamic countries' stock exchanges are still infantile. The central aim of this research, therefore, is to investigate factors impeding stock market development (SMD) in Islamic countries. We explore a panel annual data of 11 main Islamic countries vis-à-vis the developed countries for the period of 1996-2011. The findings show that all of our concerned macroeconomic determinants play a major role in the developed countries. On the other hand, financial openness has substantially less contribution in Islamic countries, while the financial intermediary development plays a major role. The results are also indicative of the need for the Islamic countries to improve their legal environment and economic freedom. Lastly, we also attempt to measure the integration level, where the findings tend to indicate a relatively lower and unstable pattern of integration for the Islamic countries, suggesting the impact of volatile inflows. © 2014. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emerging Muslim Countries; Market Integration; Stock Market Development","","","","The authors would like to express their deep gratitude to the editor, Prof. Jonathan Batten, the anonymous referee and the participants of the 15th Malaysian Finance Association Annual Conference held in June 2013 for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

According to the specific influencing factors of the Eurozone a recommendation of allocating equity portfolios with respect to industrial or regional factors is given by an empirical analysis. As most common and significant benchmark index for the Eurozone, the Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50 is analysed according to index effects. This serves as comparison and consideration of the active anticipations of index membership exchanges and a simple index investment during short- and long-term periods. Furthermore a correlation weighted equity index, established by different TMI industry indices of the Eurozone is calculated, which serves as benefit for diversification opportunities of two multidimensionally diversified and systamatically allocated multi asset portfolios.

The difficulty in forecasting arises from the nonlinearity and non-stationarity inherent in exchange rate dynamics. To address these problems, this study proposes a hybrid model that couples two effective feature extraction techniques, phase space reconstruction, and wavelet analysis, with a Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) model to forecast chaotic exchange rates. The time series inputs are first mapped into high-dimension phase space, and then the phase space signal is decomposed on a wavelet basis to analyze its dynamics under various frequencies. Finally, each wavelet component is fed into a local RVR to perform non-parametric regression and forecasting. Compared with other forecasting models, such as support vector machines (SVR), RVR, GJR-GARCH or pure wavelet-base models, the proposed model performs best and statistically improves forecasting performance under root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and directional symmetry (DS). © 2012 ISSN 1349-4198. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chaos Theory; Phase-space Reconstruction; Relevance Vector Regression; Support Vector Regression; Time Series Forecasting; Wavelet Analysis; Exchange Rate Forecasting; Exchange Rates; Feature Extraction Techniques; Forecasting Models; Forecasting Performance; Hybrid Model; Mean Absolute Error; Non-linearity; Non-parametric Regression; Non-stationarities; Phase Space Reconstruction; Phase Spaces; Relevance Vector Regression; Root Mean Square Errors; Support Vector Regression; Time Series Forecasting; Vector Regression Model; Wavelet Basis; Wavelet Components; Chaos Theory; Dynamics; Feature Extraction; Mean Square Error; Phase Space Methods; Regression Analysis; Time Series Analysis; Vectors; Wavelet Analysis; Forecasting","Exchange rate forecasting; Exchange rates; Feature extraction techniques; Forecasting models; Forecasting performance; Hybrid model; Mean absolute error; Non-Linearity; Non-parametric regression; Non-stationarities; Phase space reconstruction; Phase spaces; Relevance vector regression; Root mean square errors; Support vector regression; Time series forecasting; Vector regression model; Wavelet basis; Wavelet components; Chaos theory; Dynamics; Feature extraction; Mean square error; Phase space methods; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Vectors; Wavelet analysis; Forecasting","","","","Analysis of Observed Chaotic Data, (1996); Abdollahzade, Majid, Locally linear neuro-fuzzy (LLNF) electricity price forecasting in deregulated power markets, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 6, 9, pp. 4203-4218, (2010); Begum, Nadira, Automatic text summarization using support vector machine, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 5, 7, pp. 1987-1996, (2009); Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31, 3, pp. 307-327, (1986); Chang, Juifang, Anfis-based adaptive expectation model for forecasting stock index, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 5, 7, pp. 1949-1958, (2009); Chen, Rungching, Intrusion detection using a hybrid support vector machine based on entropy and tf-idf, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 4, 2, pp. 413-424, (2008); Recurrent Support Vector Regression for A Nonlinear Arma Model with Applications to Forecasting Financial Returns, (2008); Chen, Gang, Multi-class support vector machine active learning for music annotation, International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control, 6, 3, pp. 921-930, (2010); Çoban, Gürsan, Deterministic flow in phase space of exchange rates: Evidence of chaos in filtered series of Turkish Lira-Dollar daily growth rates, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 42, 2, pp. 1062-1067, (2009); Frank, Murray Z., Some evidence concerning macroeconomic chaos, Journal of Monetary Economics, 22, 3, pp. 423-438, (1988)","","","","","","","","13494198","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863257783"

The proposed model follows the Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis that assumes the unstationarity and dynamic changing nature of the underlying market structure and introduces the wavelet analysis to analyze the dynamic underlying Data Generating Process at finer time scale domain. The simple averaging based ensemble model is introduced to reduce the estimation bias resulting from the use of different wavelet families by deriving market consensus view. The ensemble members are selected dynamically based on their in-sample performance among forecast matrices based on different wavelet families. Results from empirical studies show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm against the benchmark models, in terms of both level and directional predictive accuracy. The proposed model can effectively extract and model the time varying heterogeneous market microstructure, whose accurate characterization results in further improvement in market analysis and predictability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arma Model; Crude Oil Price Forecasting; Ensemble Algorithm; Multiresolution Analysis; Wavelet Analysis; Algorithms; Benchmarking; Commerce; Costs; Crude Oil; Forecasting; Microstructure; Multiresolution Analysis; Wavelet Analysis; Arma Model; Benchmark Models; Crude Oil Prices; Empirical Studies; Ensemble Algorithms; Ensemble Members; Ensemble Models; Estimation Bias; Forecasting Accuracy; Heterogeneous Markets; Market Analysis; Market Consensus; Market Microstructures; Market Structures; Predictive Accuracy; Time Varying; Time-scales; Petroleum Analysis; Accuracy Assessment; Algorithm; Crude Oil; Decomposition; Empirical Analysis; Market Development; Performance Assessment; Timescale; Wavelet","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Commerce; Costs; Crude oil; Forecasting; Microstructure; Multiresolution analysis; Wavelet analysis; ARMA model; Benchmark models; Crude oil prices; Empirical studies; Ensemble algorithms; Ensemble members; Ensemble models; Estimation bias; Forecasting accuracy; Heterogeneous markets; Market analysis; Market consensus; Market microstructures; Market structures; Predictive accuracy; Time varying; Time-scales; Petroleum analysis; accuracy assessment; algorithm; crude oil; decomposition; empirical analysis; market development; performance assessment; timescale; wavelet","","","The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the Editor-in-Chief and the two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions, which helped improve the quality of the paper tremendously.

To address the problem, this study proposes a novel system for financial modeling and forecasting. In the first stage, wavelet analysis transforms the input space of raw data to a time-scale feature space suitable for financial modeling and forecasting. A spectral clustering algorithm is then used to partition the feature space into several disjointed regions according to their time series dynamics. In the second stage, multiple kernel partial least square regressors ideally suited to each partitioned region are constructed for final forecasting.

Design/methodology/approach – Using unexpected announcements of major macroeconomic indicators, a study is made of how daily innovations of risk factors react to macroeconomic shocks. In a Flannery and Protopapadakis framework, the impact of macroeconomics surprises on the levels and volatilities of the risk factors is measured. A VAR model is employed as a robustness check. To better understand the mechanism of announcement impacts on risk factors, the relationship between the macroeconomics announcements and Fama-French size/book-to-market portfolio returns is investigated. Findings – Inflation, employment, consumption and business activities were found to affect levels and volatilities of risk factors. However, these macro variables affect risk factors differently. Inflation and non-farm payrolls decrease the market risk premium while increasing the size premium. Personal income increases the size premium while reducing the book-to-market premium. Industrial production and GDP only influence the level of the momentum factor. In this model specification, producer inflation (PPI) and personal income increase the volatility of the size premium while business inventories increase the volatility of the market premium. Originality – This paper's results support the notion that different risk factors capture different economic fundamentals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assets; Financial Markets; Investments; Pricing; Securities Markets","","","","","Andersen, Torben G., Intraday periodicity and volatility persistence in financial markets, Journal of Empirical Finance, 4, 2-3, pp. 115-158, (1997); Barrett, W.

This study also examines the characteristics of conditional volatility in the Baltic Stock Markets (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) by using a broad range of GARCH volatility models. Correctly forecasting the volatility leads to better understanding and managing financial market risk. Daily returns from four Baltic stock indexes are used; Estonia (TALSE index), Latvia (RIGSE index), Lithuania (VILSE index) and synthetic BALTIC benchmark index. We test a large family of GARCH models, including; the basic GARCH model, GARCH-in-mean model, asymmetric exponential GARCH and GJR GARCH, power GARCH and component GARCH model. We find strong evidence that daily returns from Baltic Stock Markets can be successfully modelled by GARCH-type models. For all Baltic markets, we conclude that increased risk will not necessarily lead to a rise in the returns. All of the analysed indexes exhibit complex time series characteristics involving asymmetry, long tails and complex autoregression in the returns. Results from this study are firmly recommended to financial officers and international investors. © Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, 2010. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Baltic Stock Markets; Conditional Volatility; Financial Risk; Garch Models; Returns","","","","An important feature of financial returns known as “leverage effect”, that was first documented by Black (1976) describes the tendency for changes in the financial returns, especially in the stock market, to be negatively correlated with changes in stock volatility. A part of this phenomenon can be explained by the fixed costs that companies incur, such as financial and operational leverage. Lowering of stock price reduces the value of company’s equity relative to its debt, thus raising its debt to equity ratio, which raises the volatility of a stock making them riskier to hold. Black (1976) argues that the response of stock volatility to the direction of returns is too large to be explained by leverage alone. This conclusion is also supported by the work of Christie (1982) and Schwert (1989). Simply stated, if volatility is higher following a negative return than it is following a positive return, then the autocorrelation between yesterday’s return and today’s squared return will be large and negative.","Adekola, Abel Femi, Approach to innovative activities by Lithuanian companies in the current conditions of development, Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 14, 4, pp. 595-611, (2008); Journal of Business, (1989); Risk Management and Analysis Measuring and Modelling Financial Risk, (1999); Market Models A Guide to Financial Data Analysis, (2001); International Journal of Finance and Economics, (2009); Proceedings of the American Statistical Association Business and Economic Statistics Section, (1976); Journal of Business, (1974); Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31, 3, pp. 307-327, (1986); Christiansen, Charlotte Ettrup, Decomposing European bond and equity volatility, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 15, 2, pp. 105-122, (2010); Christie, Andrew A., The stochastic behavior of common stock variances.

The findings indicate that stock returns are lower on the days around a full moon than on the days around a new moon. The magnitude of the return difference is 3% to 5% per annum based on analyses of two global portfolios: one equal-weighted and the other value-weighted. The return difference is not due to changes in stock market volatility or trading volumes. The data show that the lunar effect is not explained away by announcements of macroeconomic indicators, nor is it driven by major global shocks. Moreover, the lunar effect is independent of other calendar-related anomalies such as the January effect, the day-of-week effect, the calendar month effect, and the holiday effect (including lunar holidays). © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

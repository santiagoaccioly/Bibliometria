This study applies the behavioral agency model to investigate the role of top managers’ risk bearing—stemming from cash compensation and stock options—in shaping the adoption of GSCM practices. We use data from A-share listed firms in China during 2014 to 2022 and find that higher risk bearing reduces managers’ willingness to adopt GSCM. This effect is intensified under conditions of high managerial myopia and environmental uncertainty but attenuates when these factors are low. These findings offer insights for firms and policymakers in designing strategies that align managerial incentives with sustainable supply chain practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Agency Model; Environmental Uncertainty; Green Supply Chain Management Practices; Managerial Myopia; Risk Bearing","","","","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Major Projects of Fujian Social Science Research Base (Grant No. FJ2024JDZ015) and MOE (Ministry of Education of China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant No. 23YJAZH194).

Thailand is characterized by a culture of high secrecy, strong uncertainty avoidance, and strong societal trust. The primary aim of this study is to analyze the local language versions of auditors’ reports, as they may differ from English-translated versions due to cultural and linguistic variations. To achieve this, we compiled a bag of Thai words to analyze the content of KAM sections in 334 publicly listed Thai companies during the period 2016–2017. We found that investor sentiment responds marginally to only three categories of KAMs and neutral words within KAM sections. However, investors do not react to the number of KAMs or to words associated with negativity, positivity, litigation, or uncertainty. These results suggest that KAM disclosures hold limited information value for investors. Regulators and standard setters successfully educated investors and other stakeholders about KAM disclosures before their implementation. However, in a high-secrecy environment, the use of neutral language in KAM sections triggers investor skepticism, leading to stock price discounts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Audit Report; Informative Value; Investor Reaction; Investor Sentiment; Key Audit Matters; Thailand","","","","This work was supported by the Faculty of Business Administration, Chiang Mai University, Thailand.

This study focuses on forecasting realized volatility in stock indices using advanced machine learning techniques. We examine three key indices: the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite (SSE), Infosys (INFY), and the National Stock Exchange Index (NIFTY). To achieve this, we propose a hybrid model that combines optimized Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with deep learning methods like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Using data from 2015 to 2022, we analyse how well these models predict volatility. Our findings reveal distinct patterns: the SSE shows high unpredictability, INFY is prone to extreme positive volatility, and NIFTY is relatively moderate. Among the models tested, the Q-VMD-ANN-LSTM-GRU hybrid model consistently performs best, providing highly accurate predictions for all three indices. This model has practical benefits for financial institutions. It improves risk management, supports investment decisions, and provides real-time insights for traders and risk managers. Additionally, it can enhance stress testing and inspire innovative trading strategies.

Using principal component analysis of the scores of four Lexicon dictionaries to analyze speeches from June 1, 1996, to September 30, 2023, we find convincing evidence of a significant reaction to the sentiment index by the consumer discretionary, financial, information technology, raw materials, real estate, and utilities sectors. This reaction is asymmetric, as negative sentiments affect the US sectors more quickly than positive sentiments. Among the sectors, communication services, industrial, consumer staples, and energy sectors only respond significantly to negative sentiments.

Firstly, it enhances the reliability and transparency of machine-learning-based models for predicting future changes in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Secondly, it explores the relationship between ex-ante expected changes in ESG and future stock returns. This study collects 3258 STOXX Europe 600 firm-year observations. In the ESG prediction phase, two machine learning algorithms (logistic regression and random forest) are utilised to develop ESG forecasting models. Hyperparameter optimisation and walk-forward validation techniques are employed to address issues of underestimation and information leakage. The machine-learning-based ESG forecasting models are evaluated using three metrics: accuracy, area under the curve (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR). Subsequently, this study investigates the relationship between ex-ante expected ESG changes and future stock returns using the predicted ESG changes. A positive correlation is found between ex-ante expected ESG changes and future stock returns. The supplementary tests also reveal that this positive relationship is highly and statistically significant among large firms and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, this study introduces a robust and transparent approach for constructing effective machine-learning-based ESG forecasting models using hyperparameter optimisation and walk-forward validation. Additionally, traditional regression analyses are modernised by incorporating machine-learning-predicted independent variables. Furthermore, the findings provide empirical support for stakeholder, agency and resource-based theories. Finally, practical insights are provided to facilitate ESG-focused investment portfolio decision making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esg Prediction; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Stock Returns","","","","","Abdi, Yaghoub, Exploring the impact of sustainability (ESG) disclosure on firm value and financial performance (FP) in airline industry: the moderating role of size and age, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 4, pp. 5052-5079, (2022); Abdullah, Mohammad, The implication of machine learning for financial solvency prediction: an empirical analysis on public listed companies of Bangladesh, Journal of Asian Business and Economic Studies, 28, 4, pp. 303-320, (2021); Ahmad, Nisar, Revisiting the impact of ESG on financial performance of FTSE350 UK firms: Static and dynamic panel data analysis, Cogent Business and Management, 8, 1, (2021); Albuquerque, Rui, Resiliency of environmental and social stocks: An analysis of the exogenous COVID-19 market crash, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, 9, 3, pp. 593-621, (2020); Assaf, Cynthia, ESG investing: Does one score fit all investors’ preferences?, Journal of Cleaner Production, 443, (2024); Audretsch, David B., The rate of hazard confronting new firms and plants in U.S. manufacturing, Review of Industrial Organization, 9, 1, pp. 41-56, (1994); Predicting Companies Esg Ratings from News Articles Using Multivariate Timeseries Analysis, (2022); Innovative Technology at the Interface of Finance and Operations, (2022); Bao, Yang, Detecting Accounting Fraud in Publicly Traded U.S. Firms Using a Machine Learning Approach, Journal of Accounting Research, 58, 1, pp. 199-235, (2020); Bătae, Oana Marina, The relationship between environmental, social, and financial performance in the banking sector: A European study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 290, (2021)","","Academic Press","","","","","","10958347; 08908389","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217814310"

For a comprehensive understanding of market variations, it is crucial to consider both economic-financial information and contextual factors. This research presents an explainable perspective of predicting corporate defaults for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), demonstrating the importance of incorporating contextual information to improve risk assessment. The study analyzes a dataset of Italian SMEs from the construction sector, considers the importance of sector-specific indicators, and evaluates various models using standard interpretable classification algorithms. The classifications are then compared with and without the inclusion of contextual data, and their performances are analyzed. The results of this study confirm that the integration of contextual data improves the performance of classification models, with improvements observed in metrics such as accuracy, AUROC, and specificity. Moreover, contextually enriched data contributes to a more even distribution of gains across variables considered, improving model robustness and limiting overfitting risk. This work contributes to enriching the existing body of literature on SME default prediction, particularly by emphasizing the role of contextual information in improving model explainability and performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Explainability; Multivariate Analysis; Statistical Computing; Classification (of Information); Commerce; Construction Industry; Data Accuracy; Forecasting; Classification Models; Contextual Information; Corporates; Explainability; Forecasting System; Market Variations; Multi Variate Analysis; Performance; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Statistical Computing; Risk Assessment","Classification (of information); Commerce; Construction industry; Data accuracy; Forecasting; Classification models; Contextual information; Corporates; Explainability; Forecasting system; Market variations; Multi variate analysis; Performance; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Statistical computing; Risk assessment","","","Funding text 1: MRG gratefully acknowledges the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics, HSE.; Funding text 2: C.M. gratefully acknowledges support from the Rome Technopole project, funded under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), Mission 4, Component 2, Investment 1.5 \u2013 Project Rome Technopole \u2013 CUP: B83C22003920001.

However, this model is not able to capture nonlinear structures. The hybrid model brings different perspectives to forecasting analysis. This model uses a combination of ARIMA models and machine learning methods to overcome the deficiencies of single linear or nonlinear models. This paper aims to investigate whether hybrid models increase the forecasting accuracy compared to single models such as the ARIMA, random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). To this aim in this study, the Turkish Residential Property Price Index series were analyzed with the ARIMA, RF, SVR and ANN single models and the ARIMA-RF, ARIMA-SVR and ARIMA-ANN hybrid models. The methods were compared using forecasting evaluation criteria such as the RMSE and MAE. The findings proved that the ARIMA-RF has the highest out-of-sample forecasting accuracy compared with other models. Also, the Diebold–Mariano (DM) test was used for the comparison. DM test findings show that ARIMA-SVR also has significant prediction accuracy compared to other models.

However, scholars have rarely considered the reverse construction of SaaS technical architecture from a user perspective. Design/methodology/approach In this study, we constructed a sustainable SaaS use model based on a user-driven core, information ecology theory (IET), and the integration of the expectation–confirmation model (ECM) with the task–technology matching model. We further examined the impacts of SaaS risk, users’ digital literacy, task–technology fit, and SaaS providers’ ability images on SaaS users’ satisfaction and use continuance intentions according to four dimensions: information environment, information person, information technology, and information. Findings The data analysis results showed that task–technology fit and SaaS providers’ ability images affected users’ satisfaction and perceived value, respectively, further affecting SaaS use continuance. An interesting finding was that the business level relied more on corporate ability management and digital literacy to assess value and risk, whereas the management level focused more on the overall impact of risk and corporate ability management on decision-making. Originality/value The SaaS information ecology–expectation–confirmation model (IE-ECM) proposed in this study organically combines IET and post-reception behaviour theories. In addition, it provides an important basis for SaaS service providers’ customer relationship management and customer retention strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Continuous Use; Expectation Confirmation; Information Ecology; Risk; Software As A Service; Task–technology Fit; Behavioral Research; Customer Satisfaction; Decision Making; Decision Theory; Ecology; Industrial Management; Information Management; Information Use; Risk Management; Sales; Sustainable Development; Continuous Use; Corporates; Digital Literacies; Expectation Confirmation; Expectation-confirmation Models; Information Ecology; Software-as-a- Service (saas); Task Technology Fit; User Requirements; Users' Satisfactions; Risk Assessment; Software As A Service (saas)","Behavioral research; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Decision theory; Ecology; Industrial management; Information management; Information use; Risk management; Sales; Sustainable development; Continuous use; Corporates; Digital literacies; Expectation confirmation; Expectation-confirmation models; Information ecology; Software-as-a- Service (SaaS); Task technology fit; User requirements; Users' satisfactions; Risk assessment; Software as a service (SaaS)","","","","Abbes, Molka, Adopting Digital Signatures for Complex Financial Products in the French Banking Sector: How Technology Acceptance and User Literacy Matter, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 71, pp. 5536-5546, (2024); Al-Hattami, Hamood Mohammed, What determines digital accounting systems’ continuance intention?

Our results reveal significant downside risk spillovers between the carbon market and commodity markets such as cereals, noble metals, chemical engineering, soft commodities, oil and oilseeds, and agricultural and sideline products. In contrast, the upside risk spillovers are not significant, highlighting the asymmetric risk spillover effects between the carbon market and commodity markets. Moreover, the carbon market exhibits one-way risk spillovers to nonmetallic building materials and non-ferrous metals, underscoring the heterogeneity of risk spillovers. To validate the reliability of our findings, we conduct additional robustness tests using alternative modeling strategies and sub-sample analysis, both of which confirm the presence of asymmetric risk spillovers.

Based on data collected from Chinese A-share listed companies between 2008 and 2021, we found that internal board social capital was more conducive to exploitative innovation than external board social capital; external board social capital prominently pushed a higher level of exploratory innovation than internal board social capital. The interaction of internal and external board social capital led to the emergence of ambidextrous innovation. Moreover, the interaction of board informal hierarchy with internal and external social capital fostered ambidextrous innovation, while board faultlines had the opposite effect. The findings provide a new theoretical perspective to examine the relationship between board social capital and corporate innovation, offer insights for the research on antecedents of ambidextrous innovation, and enrich the literature on the informal organization of boards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ambidextrous Innovation; Board Faultlines; Board Informal Hierarchy; Board Social Capital; Corporate Governance; Socio-technical Systems Theory","","","","We acknowledge the financial support from the Major Project of Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 22JJD630004), the Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 24&ZD084), and the Key Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21AGL002).","Adler, Paul S., Social capital: Prospects for a new concept, Academy of Management Review, 27, 1, pp. 17-40, (2002); Amin, Abu S., It's who you know that counts: Board connectedness and CSR performance, Journal of Corporate Finance, 64, (2020); Argote, Linda M., Organizational learning: From experience to knowledge, Organization Science, 22, 5, pp. 1123-1137, (2011); Group Process Group Decision Group Action, (1992); Barroso-Castro, Carmen, How boards’ internal and external social capital interact to affect firm performance, Strategic Organization, 14, 1, pp. 6-31, (2016); Benner, Mary J., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited, Academy of Management Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); American Journal of Sociology, (1987); Brochet, François, Speaking of the short-term: disclosure horizon and managerial myopia, Review of Accounting Studies, 20, 3, pp. 1122-1163, (2015); Büschgens, Thorsten, Organizational culture and innovation: A meta-analytic review, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 30, 4, pp. 763-781, (2013); Cao, Qing, Unpacking organizational ambidexterity: Dimensions, contingencies, and synergistic effects, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 781-796, (2009)","","Springer","","","","","","02174561","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011690339"

By examining these characteristics in an integrated manner, the research offers deeper insights into the organizational factors that support the establishment of strong ethical practices. Design/methodology/approach: The study identifies key attributes connected with ethics institutionalization using a complex of diverse background variables such as organizational size, regional location, industry, ownership type, legal form, organizational age, profitability and professional association membership. A two-step cluster analysis and Chi-square tests were conducted on a representative sample of 1,295 Slovak organizations, stratified by company size and region. Findings: In the subset of micro/small organizations, high ethics institutionalization is linked with private foreign ownership, the construction industry and company location in Western Slovakia. For medium/large companies, ethics institutionalization is connected with foreign ownership, presence in the capital city region, joint stock structure, association membership and profitability. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited to organizations operating within Slovakia, which may impact the generalizability of findings to other regions. In addition, the study focused on a defined set of organizational characteristics, potentially overlooking other factors that could influence ethics institutionalization. Practical implications: This research highlights which segments of businesses may benefit most from targeted ethical policies, offering managers a foundation for more effective decision-making in organizational ethics. The study’s findings can help policymakers identify specific business segments or company types needing additional regulatory guidance or support. Social implications: As businesses implement more robust ethical frameworks, they contribute to raising standards across the market, promoting fair practices and reducing the occurrence of unethical behavior in business, which can have broad societal benefits. Originality/value: This research advances theoretical and practical understanding of organizational ethics by examining a range of organizational characteristics, rarely explored in conjunction, with respect to ethics institutionalization. The uniqueness of this study also lies in its focus on one of the Central and Eastern European countries, a context that remains understudied in business ethics, providing valuable perspectives on a posttransformation business environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Ethics; Central And Eastern Europe; Company Size; Ethics Institutionalization; Ethics Program; Formal Ethics Elements; Organizational Ethics","","","","","Adams, Dawda, Social and environmental practices and corporate financial performance of multinational corporations in emerging markets: Evidence from 20 oil-rich African countries, Resources Policy, 78, (2022); Agarwala, Nidhi, Do firm attributes impact CSR participation?

In light of this, we present a promising approach for investigating the key levers of financial sustainability from a variety of financial indicators. The empirical investigation focuses on the financial performance of major luxury players from 2017 to 2022, starting from the analysis of 20 financial indicators sourced from the literature. Given the multi-layer structure of the data, Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis (HMFA) is employed to discern the primary dimensions of financial sustainability over time. Then, mixed-effects model is used to estimate organizations’ stock market performance using the extracted factors, while considering both fixed and random effects. Empirical findings reveal that financial sustainability encompasses four strategic dimensions, with profitability being the main catalyst for enhancing company value and attracting investors’ interests. Finally, this novel approach offers a new and integrated method, including metric and graphical tools, to measure corporate financial sustainability and recognize patterns at every level of the hierarchy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Statement Analysis; Financial Sustainability; Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis; Luxury Industry; Mixed-effects Model","","","","Demaria gratefully acknowledges financial support from the PRIN project \u201CTowards a Circular Economy: A Business Model Innovation Perspective\u201D, project code: 2022STRZYZ (CUP: E53D23006450006).

However, the existing research only focuses on the linear relationship between a single characteristic and digital transformation. In this study, we select the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020, innovatively use the machine learning method and explore the differences in the predictive effects of multi-dimensional features on the digital transformation of enterprises based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theory, thus identifying the main drivers affecting digital transformation and the fitting models with stronger predictive effect. The study found that: first, by comparing machine learning and traditional linear regression models, it is found that the prediction ability of ensemble earning method is generally higher than that of tradition measurement method. For the sample data selected in this research, XGBoost and LightGBM have strong explanatory ability and high prediction accuracy. Second, compared with the technical driving force and environmental driving force, the organizational driving force has a greater impact. Third, among these characteristics, equity concentration and executives’ knowledge level in organizational dimension have the greatest impact on digital transformation. Therefore, enterprise managers should always pay attention to the decision-making role of equity concentration and executives’ knowledge level.

The author further divides the sample into financially sound and financially constrained firms and re-examines the relationship between EPU and promoters’ share pledging activity for them. Additionally, the author investigates the moderating effect of EPU on firm-level cash holding for pledged firms. Design/methodology/approach: The author conducts multiple regression to examine the effect of EPU on the share-pledging activity of a firm on sample data of Indian construction and real estate firms. The financial and pledging data was collected for all listed firms from March 2009 to March 2020 from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. The EPU data was re-estimated using the three-period moving average method. All data used in the study was collected from secondary sources. Findings: The author finds that EPU influences pledging activity, and the association between them is opposite for financially constrained and financially sound firms. Also, the author reports that an increase in EPU increases firm-level cash holding for pledged firms, and the interaction between EPU and share pledging is significantly associated with firm-level cash holding. Practical implications: The managerial implications of this study are manifold. Managers of financially constrained firms should pay attention to the promoters pledging activity so that in a rising EPU environment, issues of managerial entrenchment can be avoided. Moreover, any further promoters’ share pledging activity under rising EPU conditions may force managers to hoard higher cash and thus reducing investment and profitability. Originality/value: This paper presents evidence of relationship between EPU, share pledging activity and firm-level cash holding in an emerging economy. The study also compares the response of financially constrained and financially sound firms for EPU on equity pledging activity and that of equity pledging on firm-level cash holdings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cash Holding; Economic Policy Uncertainty; Financially Constrained Firms; Share Pledging","","","","","Ahn, Seoungpil, Cash holdings, corporate governance, and acquirer returns, Financial Innovation, 1, 1, (2015); Akron, Sagi, Economic policy uncertainty and corporate investment: Evidence from the U.S. hospitality industry, Tourism Management, 77, (2020); International Journal of Construction Management, (2008); Magni, Carlo Alberto, Investment decisions, net present value and bounded rationality, Quantitative Finance, 9, 8, pp. 967-979, (2009); Almeida, Heitor V., Financial constraints, asset tangibility, and corporate investment, Review of Financial Studies, 20, 5, pp. 1429-1460, (2007); Anderson, Ronald C., Insider Share-Pledging and Equity Risk, Journal of Financial Services Research, 58, 1, pp. 1-25, (2020); Angrist, Joshua D., Instrumental variables and the search for identification: From supply and demand to natural experiments, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15, 4, pp. 69-85, (2001); Baker, Scott R., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Modern Corporation and Private Property, (1932); Esparza-Rodríguez, Saúl Alfonso, Irreversibility, uncertainty, and cyclical investment, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 98, 1, pp. 85-106, (1983)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","13664387; 17598443","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193839508"

This paper employs a dynamic Bayesian network approach, grounded in social exchange theory, to construct a dynamic model of the evolution of trust levels between owners and PMC contractors. The findings of the study suggest that the trust level between the owner and the PMC contractor is primarily influenced by the extent of calculative and relational trust. Furthermore, the reciprocal behaviours and contractual flexibility emerge as the key drivers of both calculative and relational trust. Furthermore, reciprocal behaviours exert a more pronounced influence on the advancement of relational trust, whereas contract flexibility exerts a more pronounced influence on the advancement of calculative trust. Additionally, the level of calculative trust is higher at the outset of project implementation, with the generation of calculative trust subsequently leading to the generation of relational trust in the middle and later stages. In the middle and later stages of the project, the importance of relational trust increases, reaching a point where it surpasses that of calculative trust. Furthermore, the decline of relational trust has a greater negative impact on the overall trust level than calculative trust. The results of the research can provide theoretical guidance for the construction body to solve the problem of a low level of trust in the process of PMC project implementation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Calculative Trust; Contract Flexibility; Reciprocal Behaviours; Relational Trust; Trust Level; Behavioral Research; Contractors; Calculative Trust; Contract Flexibility; Dynamic Bayesian Networks; Late Stage; Management Contracting; Mechanistic Analysis; Project Implementation; Reciprocal Behavior; Relational Trust; Trust Level; Project Management","Behavioral research; Contractors; Calculative trust; Contract flexibility; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Late stage; Management contracting; Mechanistic analysis; Project implementation; Reciprocal behavior; Relational trust; Trust level; Project management","","","This research was funded by Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, fund number: 2024SJYB1614 and Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, fund number: 1122932401.","Liu, Zhixue, Fostering Digitalization of Construction Projects through Integration: A Conceptual Project Governance Model, Buildings, 13, 3, (2023); Barretta, Antonio Davide Davide, PFIs involving multiple public partners: a case study from the Italian healthcare sector, Public Money and Management, 38, 7, pp. 519-526, (2018); Ivić, Ivona, Mitigation Measures for Information Asymmetry between Participants in Construction Projects: The Impact of Trust, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 16, (2024); Song, Jinbo, Cluster Analysis of the Intellectual Structure of PPP Research, Journal of Management in Engineering, 35, 1, (2019); Cerić, Anita, Reducing information asymmetry and building trust in projects using blockchain technology, Gradevinar, 73, 10, pp. 967-978, (2021); Moradi, Sina, Success in collaborative construction through the lens of project delivery elements, Built Environment Project and Asset Management, 12, 6, pp. 973-991, (2022); Chrisman, James J., Stewardship Theory: Realism, Relevance, and Family Firm Governance, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 43, 6, pp. 1051-1066, (2019); Li, Hongyan, An empirical study on the formation mechanism of trust between the owner and the PMC contractor under the PMC model, Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 14, 5, (2023); Pirson, Michael A., Formation of Stakeholder Trust in Business and the Role of Personal Values, Journal of Business Ethics, 145, 1, pp. 1-20, (2017); Dupont, Quentin, The Trust Triangle: Laws, Reputation, and Culture in Empirical Finance Research, Journal of Business Ethics, 163, 2, pp. 217-238, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20755309","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210264462"

Firstly, it enhances the reliability and transparency of machine-learning-based models for predicting future changes in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Secondly, it explores the relationship between ex-ante expected changes in ESG and future stock returns. This study collects 3258 STOXX Europe 600 firm-year observations. In the ESG prediction phase, two machine learning algorithms (logistic regression and random forest) are utilised to develop ESG forecasting models. Hyperparameter optimisation and walk-forward validation techniques are employed to address issues of underestimation and information leakage. The machine-learning-based ESG forecasting models are evaluated using three metrics: accuracy, area under the curve (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR). Subsequently, this study investigates the relationship between ex-ante expected ESG changes and future stock returns using the predicted ESG changes. A positive correlation is found between ex-ante expected ESG changes and future stock returns. The supplementary tests also reveal that this positive relationship is highly and statistically significant among large firms and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, this study introduces a robust and transparent approach for constructing effective machine-learning-based ESG forecasting models using hyperparameter optimisation and walk-forward validation. Additionally, traditional regression analyses are modernised by incorporating machine-learning-predicted independent variables.Furthermore, the findings provide empirical support for stakeholder, agency and resource-based theories. Finally, practical insights are provided to facilitate ESG-focused investment portfolio decision making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esg Prediction; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Stock Returns","","","","","Abdi, Yaghoub, Exploring the impact of sustainability (ESG) disclosure on firm value and financial performance (FP) in airline industry: the moderating role of size and age, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 4, pp. 5052-5079, (2022); Abdullah, Mohammad, The implication of machine learning for financial solvency prediction: an empirical analysis on public listed companies of Bangladesh, Journal of Asian Business and Economic Studies, 28, 4, pp. 303-320, (2021); Ahmad, Nisar, Revisiting the impact of ESG on financial performance of FTSE350 UK firms: Static and dynamic panel data analysis, Cogent Business and Management, 8, 1, (2021); Albuquerque, Rui, Resiliency of environmental and social stocks: An analysis of the exogenous COVID-19 market crash, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, 9, 3, pp. 593-621, (2020); Assaf, Cynthia, ESG investing: Does one score fit all investors’ preferences?, Journal of Cleaner Production, 443, (2024); Audretsch, David B., The rate of hazard confronting new firms and plants in U.S. manufacturing, Review of Industrial Organization, 9, 1, pp. 41-56, (1994); Predicting Companies Esg Ratings from News Articles Using Multivariate Timeseries Analysis, (2022); Innovative Technology at the Interface of Finance and Operations, (2022); Bao, Yang, Detecting Accounting Fraud in Publicly Traded U.S. Firms Using a Machine Learning Approach, Journal of Accounting Research, 58, 1, pp. 199-235, (2020); Bătae, Oana Marina, The relationship between environmental, social, and financial performance in the banking sector: A European study, Journal of Cleaner Production, 290, (2021)","","Academic Press","","","","","","10958347; 08908389","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200854541"

It suggests proactive strategies for sustainable growth and explores the potential of corporate diversification. Design/methodology/approach: Utilising a thematic critical literature review, specific inclusion/exclusion criteria are used to select relevant literature together with a thematic qualitative synthesis data analysis approach to identify trends and challenges. Findings: UK CCFs primarily use reactive and project-based strategic management, which may not align with long-term success due to market volatility, reactive supply, fragmentation, high competition and lack of differentiation. The short-term business cycle makes medium- to long-term strategy development difficult. It is recommended that CCFs adopt proactive strategic management and consider corporate diversification for enhanced competitiveness, stability and performance. Although there are conflicting findings on the impact of diversification on firm performance, this research suggests that it is a viable strategy for achieving enhanced firm performance and competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: The importance of proactive corporate strategies for CCFs is emphasised to overcome industry challenges, promote sustainable growth and enhance competitiveness. Corporate diversification, cultural transformation, management qualifications promotion and talent development collaboration are advocated, providing valuable insights for practitioners, policymakers and researchers. Practical implications: The practical implications of this research involve fostering a shift towards proactive and dynamic strategic management in the UK construction industry, addressing the historical neglect of broader strategic perspectives and empowering practitioners and academics to drive positive change and innovation within the sector. Social implications: The social implications of this research encompass the potential to enhance the overall efficiency, sustainability and collaborative dynamics within the UK construction industry, which can ultimately contribute to improved infrastructure development and the well-being of communities. Originality/value: Project-driven strategic management in the UK construction industry is explored, questioning the reactive approach used by CCFs. It provides insights, best practices and improvement areas, emphasising diversification, proactive corporate strategies, cultural shifts and industry improvement, spanning theory, practice and theory. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction Contracting Firms; Diversification; Project-based Strategies; Strategic Management; Uk Construction Industry","","","","","Akintoye, Akintola S., Profitability of UK construction contractors, Construction Management and Economics, 9, 4, pp. 311-325, (1991); International Journal of Organizational Leadership, (2016); Construction Contractors Market Report Focus on Sector Capability and Strategy Uk 2017 2021 Analysis, (2017); Journal of Management Governance, (2017); Implanting Strategic Management, (1984); Atlas International Conference of Research in Applied Sciences, (2023); Bearman, Margaret L., Qualitative synthesis and systematic review in health professions education, Medical Education, 47, 3, pp. 252-260, (2013); Benito Osorio, D., Four decades of research on product diversification: A literature review, Management Decision, 50, 2, pp. 325-344, (2012); Management Science, (1985); Betts, Martin P., Strategic planning for competitive advantage in construction, Construction Management and Economics, 10, 6, pp. 511-532, (1992)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","20441258; 2044124X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205082934"

Results reveal that technological diversity, as a people-independent intangible resource, positively affects firm resilience. This effect is achieved through the mediating effects of product, customer, and market diversity. Meanwhile, as people-dependent intangible resources, managerial ability positively moderates the relationship between technological diversity and firm resilience, whereas political connections negatively moderate the relationship between technological diversity and firm resilience.

Various prediction methodologies have been proposed to achieve more accurate predictions. So far, most studies have focused on making predictions using artificial intelligence models fed with accounting information only or a combination of accounting information and other category or categories of information. This study proposes new corporate governance drivers that exploit company relational information using board of directors’ networks of companies and the concept of node embeddings obtained by mapping large directors’ networks to lower-dimensional spaces. The contribution of these new drivers to the overall prediction performance is assessed using data on UK companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. The proposed two-stage methodology consists of devising new drivers in the first stage followed by risk class prediction in the second stage. We examine different complex network structures that capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in directors’ networks. Empirical results suggest that the proposed network-based drivers that use company relational corporate governance information significantly improve the performance of bankruptcy prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bankruptcy Prediction; Complex Network Analysis; Drivers; Machine Learning; Node2vec; Complex Networks; Forecasting; Information Use; Accounting Informations; Analysis Approach; Bankruptcy Prediction; Complex Network Analysis; Corporate Governance; Corporates; Driver; Machine-learning; Node2vec; Prediction Methodology; Machine Learning","Complex networks; Forecasting; Information use; Accounting informations; Analysis approach; Bankruptcy prediction; Complex network analysis; Corporate governance; Corporates; Driver; Machine-learning; Node2vec; Prediction methodology; Machine learning","","","","Afik, Zvika, Using Merton model for default prediction: An empirical assessment of selected alternatives, Journal of Empirical Finance, 35, pp. 43-67, (2016); Ahmadi, Zahra, Towards bankruptcy prediction: Deep sentiment mining to detect financial distress from business management reports, pp. 293-302, (2018); undefined, (2018); Almaskati, Nawaf Abdulnabi, A horse race of models and estimation methods for predicting bankruptcy, Advances in Accounting, 52, (2021); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Distressed Firm and Bankruptcy Prediction in an International Context A Review and Empirical Analysis of Altmans Z Score Model, (2014); Ankerst, Mihael, OPTICS: Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure, SIGMOD Record, 28, 2, pp. 49-60, (1999); Appiah, Kingsley Opoku, The impact of board quality and nomination committee on corporate bankruptcy, Advances in Accounting, 35, pp. 75-81, (2016); Bharath, Sreedhar T., Forecasting default with the Merton distance to default model, Review of Financial Studies, 21, 3, pp. 1339-1369, (2008); Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198042880"

The present study aims to fill this gap by exploring how this relationship is affected by factors such as chief executive officer (CEO) career horizon, TMT heterogeneity, and board size. This study develops and tests hypotheses with a sample of 90 construction firms in China from 2008 to 2017. The findings indicate that firms voluntarily issuing CSR reports are more likely to engage in illegal activities when the CEO career is longer and TMT heterogeneity is lower. Regarding the moderating role of board size, the result shows that large board size may not always imply better monitoring. While the positive impacts of CSR have been extensively emphasized, this study provides confirmation that it can also potentially lead to adverse behavior, such as corporate misconduct. Aligned with the upper echelon theory, this study substantiates the moderating roles of CEOs and TMTs. These findings are poised to make a contribution to the academic domain of CSR by elucidating the potential adverse outcomes of CSR activities and delineating the boundaries within which such outcomes occur. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Size; Chief Executive Officer (ceo) Career Horizon; Corporate Misconduct; Corporate Social Responsibility (csr); Top Management Teams (tmt) Heterogeneity; Construction Industry; Human Resource Management; Board Size; Boards Of Directors; Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer Career Horizon; Corporate Misconduct; Corporate Social Responsibility; Decision-making Process; Top Management Team Heterogeneity; Top Management Teams; Decision Making","Construction industry; Human resource management; Board size; Boards of directors; Chief executive officer; Chief executive officer career horizon; Corporate misconduct; Corporate social responsibility; Decision-making process; Top management team heterogeneity; Top management teams; Decision making","","","The authors are grateful to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72101086) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (531118010600).","Aktas, Nihat, Reductions in CEO career horizons and corporate policies, Journal of Corporate Finance, 66, (2021); Albuquerque, Rui, Corporate social responsibility and firm risk: Theory and empirical evidence, Management Science, 65, 10, pp. 4451-4469, (2019); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1992); Antia, Murad J., CEO decision horizon and firm performance: An empirical investigation, Journal of Corporate Finance, 16, 3, pp. 288-301, (2010); Badertscher, Brad A., The separation of ownership and control and corporate tax avoidance, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 56, 2-3, pp. 228-250, (2013); Bantel, Karen A., Top management and innovations in banking: Does the composition of the top team make a difference?, Strategic Management Journal, 10, 1 S, pp. 107-124, (1989); Barker, Vincent L., CEO characteristics and firm R&D spending, Management Science, 48, 6, pp. 782-801, (2002); Binacci, Martina, Are All Non-Family Managers (NFMs) Equal?

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 131 Indian IPO prospectuses (104 non-financial and 27 financial) issued between 2015 and 2021. Content analysis was performed to identify mutually exclusive risk categories, and the effects of these categories on initial IPO returns were assessed by regression analysis Findings: The findings revealed that risk factor disclosures have a significant impact on underpricing, but not all risk factors are relevant. In the current study, in the financial sector, IPO underpricing was mostly driven by technological and competitive risk factors. In the non-financial sector, underpricing was predominantly influenced by operating risk and compliance risk factors. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study include the use of sentence-based context analysis, which does not assess the quality of risk disclosures. The statistical data reduction technique used to generate mutually exclusive risk categories may also be a limitation. Practical implications: This research has the potential to assist companies in standardizing the disclosure of risks within IPO prospectuses. The insights gained can inform market regulators in designing policies aimed at aiding investors in formulating investment strategies, ultimately enhancing transparency and clarity regarding information disclosure. Moreover, the findings offer valuable guidance to investors in selecting IPOs aligned with their risk tolerance levels. Social implications: From a societal perspective, this study represents advancements by guiding regulators towards developing and regulating standardized, mutually exclusive risk factors.

Design/methodology/approach: We examine the association of IPO performance and post-listing firm’s performance with issuers' pre-listing financial and qualitative traits using panel data regression. Findings: IPOs floated in the Indian market from July 2009 to March 31, 2022, evince the notable influence of issuers' pre-IPO fundamentals and legitimacy traits on IPO returns and post-listing earning power. Where the pandemic’s favorable impact is discerned on the post-listing year earning power of the issuer firms, the loss-making issuers appear to be adversely affected by the Covid disruption. Perhaps, the successful listing equipped the issuers with the financial flexibility to combat market challenges vis-à-vis failed issuers deprived of desired IPO proceeds. Research limitations/implications: High initial returns followed by a declining pattern substantiate the retail investors to be less informed vis-à-vis initial investors, valuers and underwriters, who exit post-listing after profit booking. Investing in the shares of the newly listed ventures post-listing in the secondary market can shield retail investors from the uncertainty losses of being uninformed. The IPO market needs stringent regulations ensuring the verification of the listing valuation, the firm’s credentials and the intent of utilizing IPO proceeds. Healthy development of the IPO market merits reconsidering the listing of ventures with weak fundamentals suspected to withstand the market challenges. Originality/value: Given the tremendous rise in the new firm venturing into the primary market and the spike in IPOs countering the losses immediately post-opening, the study examines the loss-making and young firms IPOs separately, adding novelty to the study. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19 Impact; Financial Fundamentals; Legitimacy Signals; Post-ipo Returns; Post-ipo Sustainability","","","","","Agarwal, Sweta, Corporate governance and its impact on long-term performance of Indian IPOs: an empirical investigation, International Journal of Business Excellence, 27, 4, pp. 571-593, (2022); Aggarwal, Rajesh K., The impact of fundamentals on IPO valuation, Financial Management, 38, 2, pp. 253-284, (2009); Aghamolla, Cyrus, Strategic timing of IPOs and disclosure: A dynamic model of multiple firms, Accounting Review, 96, 3, pp. 27-57, (2021); Ahmad-Zaluki, Nurwati Ashikkin, Intended use of IPO proceeds and initial returns, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 19, 2, pp. 184-210, (2021); Alanazi, Ahmed S., The ownership change and IPO firm performance: Evidence from the six emerging markets, Corporate Ownership and Control, 12, 4, pp. 156-169, (2015); Ali, Heba Ahmed Abass, Behavioral Timing, Valuation and Postissue Performance of UK Initial Public Offerings, Journal of Behavioral Finance, 18, 2, pp. 152-166, (2017); Anagnostopoulou, Seraina C., Earnings management by classification shifting and IPO survival, Journal of Corporate Finance, 66, (2021); Anand, Ramit, Do Firm- and Board-specific Characteristics Corroborate Underpricing?

In Türkiye, as in many countries, the deposit banks cut mortgage interest rates. Thus, Türkiye has experienced large increases in house prices, as have many countries. Türkiye has also become the country with the highest average annual rate of house price increase among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries during the pandemic period. However, despite an increase in the number of studies on house prices or mortgage loans during the pandemic period, there is a research gap in terms of a comparison of the relationship between house prices and mortgage loans in the pre-pandemic and the pandemic periods compared with that on other assets or in other sectors,. This study aims to rectify this gap. To achieve this, both the Fourier Granger and the Fourier Toda-Yamamoto causality tests are used. The results indicate that there are differences in both periods of time with respect to the relationship between mortgage loans and house prices in Türkiye, and that there is a causal relationship between both factors in the pre-pandemic period, but not during the pandemic period. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Covid-19 Pandemic; House Price; Mortgage Loan","","","","","Adkins, Lisa, The asset economy during and after the Covid-19 crisis, IPPR Progressive Review, 28, 3, pp. 242-252, (2021); Real Estate Finance Fall, (2022); Aksoy Khurami, Esma, Trends in housing markets during the economic crisis and Covid-19 pandemic: Turkish case, Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science, 6, 3, pp. 1159-1175, (2022); Allen-Coghlan, Matthew, The potential impact of Covid-19 on the Irish housing sector, International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis, 14, 4, pp. 636-651, (2020); Journal of Economic Perspectives, (1995); Bordo, Michael David, Economic policy uncertainty and the credit channel: Aggregate and bank level U.S. evidence over several decades, Journal of Financial Stability, 26, pp. 90-106, (2016); Bordo, Michael David, An overview of the Fed's new credit policy tools and their cushioning effect on the COVID-19 recession, Journal of Government and Economics, 3, (2021); Brissimis, Sophocles N., The interaction between mortgage financing and housing prices in greece, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 39, 2, pp. 146-164, (2009); Turk Bankaclk Sektoru Temel Gostergeleri 22 Mart, (2022); Monetary Policy and Covid 19, (2021)","","Global Social Science Institute","","","","","","21548919","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201800167"

This innovative test simultaneously considers changes in linear, asymmetric, and extremal dependences during crisis periods. By employing this test, we construct contagion networks to gauge the degree of influence among markets within the network system. Our findings unveil that US-sourced crises exert a greater impact on BRICS stock markets compared to non-US-sourced crises. Notably, through dynamic contagion analysis, we ascertain that US-sourced financial crises affect approximately 50% of crisis days on average in the BRICS equity markets, whereas the impact of non-US-sourced crises varies based on their severity and characteristics. Additionally, our exploration of network analysis reveals that US-sourced crises demonstrate more prominent source node attributes within the network encompassing BRICS equity markets, in contrast to non-US-sourced crises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brics; Co-moments; Contagion; Financial Crisis; Network","","","","","Aboagye, Ernest, A contagion test with unspecified heteroscedastic errors, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 159, (2024); European Financial Management, (2022); Anastasopoulos, Alexia, Testing for financial contagion: New evidence from the Greek crisis and yuan devaluation, Research in International Business and Finance, 45, pp. 499-511, (2018); Arouri, Mohamed El Hédi, Volatility spillovers between oil prices and stock sector returns: Implications for portfolio management, Journal of International Money and Finance, 30, 7, pp. 1387-1405, (2011); BenSaïda, Ahmed, The contagion effect in European sovereign debt markets: A regime-switching vine copula approach, International Review of Financial Analysis, 58, pp. 153-165, (2018); Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo, Uncovering equity market contagion among BRICS countries: An application of the multivariate GARCH model, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 67, pp. 36-44, (2018); Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo, Assessing the extent of contagion of sovereign credit risk among BRICS countries, Economics Bulletin, 40, 2, pp. 1017-1032, (2020); Caporale, Guglielmo Maria, Testing for contagion: A conditional correlation analysis, Journal of Empirical Finance, 12, 3, pp. 476-489, (2005); Chan, Joshua C.C., A regime switching skew-normal model of contagion, Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics, 23, 1, (2019); Chang, Haowen, Return and volatility connectedness among the BRICS stock and oil markets, Resources Policy, 86, (2023)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","02615606","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190505420"

The results under fixed effect estimation with robust standard errors show that firm value is positively affected by both corporate governance and TPA activities, and the integration of governance structure and social responsibility performance can enhance firm value. Internal corporate governance has a significant impact on firm TPA activities and can boost firm value. The study also highlights the importance of the fraction of independent directors to management, the board size, and ownership concentration in moderating the relationship between TPA activities and firm value. The theoretical contribution of this paper lies in its identification of the synergistic effects of corporate governance and social responsibility performance on firm value in the context of poverty alleviation.

Design/methodology/approach: The primary data collection was furnished via online questionnaires, and 310 completed questionnaires were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM), moderation analysis, multiple regression simulations and path analysis. Findings: The study shows that four out of the five CFAD dimensions observed – investors’ relations (IR), board and management structure, transparency disclosure and other disclosure channels – have a direct influence on investor's reactions to bad financial news, with the exception of “external auditing and audit service”. In addition, investor herding has a moderation impact on the relationship between CFAD and IRBFN.

However, at the microlevel, research in this area is lacking, as attention is paid on the comprehensive capabilities of top managers, industrial heterogeneity, and heterogeneous green innovation (GI), including inventive innovation and utility innovation. Based on Upper Echelons Theory, this paper constructs a research framework to explore and empirically analyze the specific impact of managerial capacity (MA) of top managers, as “gatekeepers” of enterprise decision-making, on the heterogeneous enterprise GI, as well as its potential mechanism. Our results shows that (1), overall, MA can significantly promote GI of enterprises. Interestingly, compared with green strategic innovation, managerial capacity has a greater effect on green inventive innovation; (2) based on industrial heterogeneity, in heavy-polluting industries, managerial capacity is more likely to promote green strategic innovation rather than green inventive innovation; (3) further analysis shows that enterprise value, internal control quality, and financing constraints are important mechanisms; and (4) the moderating effect of external environment shows that to some extent either the regional marketization level or management capabilities can drive GI. This paper has practical implications for policymakers and corporate managers adopting the management heterogeneity perspective and suggests areas for future studies in this field to promote green low-carbon transition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Action Mechanism; Heterogeneous Green Innovation; Industry Heterogeneity; Managerial Capacity; Corporate Strategy; Decision Making; Future Prospect; Heterogeneity; Industrial Development; Innovation; Strategic Approach; China","corporate strategy; decision making; future prospect; heterogeneity; industrial development; innovation; strategic approach; China","","","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Social Science Fund of China 22AJY006, Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China 21&ZD133, the Social Science Fund of Xinjiang 21BJY049, Social Science Cultivating Project of Xinjiang University 23GPY003, Autonomous Region Postgraduate Education Teaching Re‐form Project XJ2023GY08, Autonomous Region Postgraduate Innovation Project XJ2023G059, General Project of the Institute of Central Asian Studies of Xinjiang University (24ZYYB018), National Natural Science Foundation of China (72321002), the Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province of China (2022C35060), the Technology Innovation Program of Beijing Institute of Technology (2022CX01013), and the Special Fund for Joint Development Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education.","Accounting Research, (2022); Amore, Mario Daniele, Corporate governance and green innovation, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 75, pp. 54-72, (2016); Readings in Industrial Economics, (1972); Barney, Jay Bryan, Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Batt, Rosemary, Managing customer services: Human resource practices, quit rates, and sales growth, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 3, pp. 587-597, (2002); Beal, Reginald M., Performance implications of aligning CEO functional experiences with competitive strategies, Journal of Management, 26, 4, pp. 733-762, (2000); Bertrand, Marianne, Managing with style: The effect of managers on firm policies, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, 4, pp. 1169-1208, (2003); Finance and Trade Economics, (2016); Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Bresciani, Stefano, Using big data for co-innovation processes: Mapping the field of data-driven innovation, proposing theoretical developments and providing a research agenda, International Journal of Information Management, 60, (2021)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","09644733; 10990836","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176909609"

Like in any other company, the CEO is the manager and is responsible for achieving good performance. But unlike in non-family businesses, women are more represented in leadership positions and are more likely to work their way up. There is considerable disagreement in the literature about whether female CEOs outperform male CEOs. While some studies confirm this, other studies refute it, and other studies find no connection at all. In this study, we therefore investigate whether female CEOs perform better than male CEOs within family businesses. However, given the target group, it is essential not to ignore the influence of socio-emotional wealth (SEW) on this relationship, since family businesses distinguish themselves from other organizational forms with this characteristic. SEW includes the non-financial aspects of a business, such as a desire to maintain family control and family values that are incorporated into the corporate culture. According to SEW theory, family businesses focus more on maintaining SEW than pursuing purely economic prosperity. This can ensure that not all decisions are made with profit maximization in mind. To empirically test our hypotheses, we use a sample of 238 Belgian family businesses. Our results do not show any statistically significant results for the impact of the CEO’s gender on firm performance. What is significant, though, is the positive moderating effect of SEW on the relationship between CEO gender and performance in family businesses. The more SEW retention within a family business, the better the performance will be in the case of a female CEO. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceo; Family Businesses; Gender; Performance; Sew","","","","","Adams, Renée B., A theory of friendly boards, Journal of Finance, 62, 1, pp. 217-250, (2007); Anderson, Ronald C., Founding-Family Ownership and Firm Performance: Evidence from the S&P 500, Journal of Finance, 58, 3, pp. 1301-1327, (2003); Appelbaum, Steven H., Gender and leadership?

The objective is to minimize risks, align the portfolio with the organization’s strategic objectives and maximize portfolio returns and net present value (NPV). Design/methodology/approach: The study develops a multi-objective genetic algorithm approach to optimize the portfolio selection process. The construction company’s portfolio is categorized into four main classes: water projects, building projects, road projects and healthcare projects. A mathematical model is developed, and a genetic algorithm is implemented using MATLAB software. Data from a construction holding company in Iraq, including budget and candidate projects, are used as a case study. Findings: The case study results show that out of the 34 candidate projects, 13 have been recommended for execution. These selected projects span different portfolio classes, such as water, building, road and healthcare projects. The total budget required for executing the selected projects is $64.55m, within the organization’s budget limit. The convergence diagram of the genetic algorithm indicates that the best solutions were achieved around generation 20 and further improved from generation 60 onwards. Practical implications: The study introduces a specialized framework for project portfolio management in the construction industry, focusing on risk management and strategic alignment. It uses a multi-objective genetic algorithm and risk analysis to minimize risks, increase returns and improve portfolio performance. The case study validates its practical applicability. Originality/value: This study contributes to project portfolio management by developing a framework specifically tailored for construction holding companies. Integrating a multi-objective genetic algorithm allows for a comprehensive optimization process, taking into account various objectives, including portfolio returns, NPV, risk reduction and strategic alignment. The case study application provides practical insights and validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in a real-world setting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic Algorithm; Multi-objective Optimization; Optimal Selection; Project Management; Project Portfolio; Budget Control; Construction Industry; Financial Data Processing; Health Care; Investments; Matlab; Multiobjective Optimization; Project Management; Risk Analysis; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Roads And Streets; Building Projects; Case-studies; Holding Company; Multi-objectives Genetic Algorithms; Multi-objectives Optimization; Optimal Selection; Project Portfolio; Road Projects; The Net Present Value (npv); Water Projects; Genetic Algorithms","Budget control; Construction industry; Financial data processing; Health care; Investments; MATLAB; Multiobjective optimization; Project management; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Roads and streets; Building projects; Case-studies; Holding company; Multi-objectives genetic algorithms; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimal selection; Project portfolio; Road projects; The net present value (NPV); Water projects; Genetic algorithms","","","","Aaker, David A., MODEL FOR THE SELECTION OF INTERDEPENDENT R&D PROJECTS., IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, EM-25, 2, pp. 30-36, (1978); Abbasianjahromi, Hamidreza R., Developing a project portfolio selection model for contractor firms considering the risk factor, Journal of Civil Engineering and Management, 18, 6, pp. 879-889, (2012); Abiyev, Rahib Hidayat, Fuzzy genetic system for modelling investment portfolio, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4099 LNAI, pp. 701-710, (2006); Afshar, Mohammad Reza, Introducing a fuzzy MCDM model for financial management in multiple project environments, Construction Innovation, 22, 2, pp. 305-319, (2022); Al-Hadithi, Bevian Ismail, An investigation into factors causing delays in highway construction projects in Iraq, MATEC Web of Conferences, 162, (2018); Aliyev, Rashad R., Fuzzy approach to portfolio selection using genetic algorithms, Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing, 14, 4, pp. 525-540, (2008); Al Jassmi, Hamad Ai, Analysis of causes of construction defects using fault trees and risk importance measures, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 139, 7, pp. 870-880, (2013); Alvarez-García, Begoña, A comprehensive approach for the selection of a portfolio of interdependent projects.

Finding the reasons for the price increase is very important for economic stabilization. In this paper, it has been estimated that exorbitant price increases may be related to a free market economy. For this purpose, unlike other studies, a comparative analysis of the impact of the free market economy on prices was conducted. The study covers the period 1990–2020, and using the U.S. economy, which is a free market economy, the relationship between property rights, the size of government in the economy, and prices were examined using the autoregressive distributed lag model. The results show that the free market model has a positive effect on the price increase, while the size of the government's economy does not affect the price increase in the same direction.

In addition, the study also examines the influence of gender diversity, cultural diversity and diversity of experience on CSR and sustainable development in the two countries. Sample of non-financial sectors embedded from the S&P 1500 Index and the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) for the periods 2010 to 2020. Results are estimated based on Panel regression models and dynamic GMM. The results of the study show that, on average, corporate social responsibility and sustainable development in the United States are superior to those in Australia. The ASX Diversity Index score has a significant and positive impact on CSR funds and the Sustainability Index. However, in the USA, the Board Diversity Index only impacts CSR funds. Moreover, directors with diverse cultural background in Australian firms are highly promoting sustainable development than US ones. However, cultural diversity on US boards strongly favors CSR practices compared to their Australian counterparts. While the presence of women on the board of directors contributes positively to local CSR activities and has a negative impact on global development in both countries. In addition, the experience of the US Board of Directors has suggested more funding for community development rather than sustainable development. The results of the study make significant contributions to academics and policymakers for U.S. and Australian stock exchanges. To develop CSR practices at the national level and sustainable development at the global level, the American and Australian Security Exchange Commission needs to take initiatives through the deployment of diversified boards of directors. Based on the findings, current study supports the stakeholder theory, Upper Echelon theory and cultural trait theory. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Diversity Mechanism; Csr; Cultural Diversity; Sustainability Development; Economic And Social Effects; Financial Markets; Regression Analysis; 'current; Australia; Australian Stock Exchanges; Board Diversity Mechanism; Boards Of Directors; Corporate Social Responsibility; Csr; Cultural Diversity; Financial Sectors; Sustainability Development; Sustainable Development","Economic and social effects; Financial markets; Regression analysis; 'current; Australia; Australian stock exchanges; Board diversity mechanism; Boards of directors; Corporate social responsibility; CSR; Cultural diversity; Financial sectors; Sustainability development; Sustainable development","","","","Deakin Law Review, (2015); Adams, Carol A., Connecting the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and calls for ‘harmonisation’ of sustainability reporting, Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 82, (2022); Adams, Dawda, Globalisation, governance, accountability and the natural resource ‘curse’: Implications for socio-economic growth of oil-rich developing countries, Resources Policy, 61, pp. 128-140, (2019); Mohamed Adnan, Shayuti, The influence of culture and corporate governance on corporate social responsibility disclosure: A cross country analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 198, pp. 820-832, (2018); Aggarwal, Raj, Board diversity and firm performance: The role of business group affiliation, International Business Review, 28, 6, (2019); Al-Mamun, Abdullah, Board of director attributes and CSR engagement in emerging economy firms: Evidence from across Asia, Emerging Markets Review, 46, (2021); Aladwey, Laila Mohamed Alshawadfy, Attributes of corporate boards and assurance of corporate social responsibility reporting: evidence from the UK, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 22, 4, pp. 748-780, (2022); Alizadeh, Amin, The Drivers and Barriers of Corporate Social Responsibility: A Comparison of the MENA Region and Western Countries, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 2, (2022); Amini, Chiara, Corporate social responsibility and Latin American firm performance, Corporate Governance (Bingley), 17, 3, pp. 403-445, (2017); Amorelli, María Florencia, Critical mass of female directors, human capital, and stakeholder engagement by corporate social reporting, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 27, 1, pp. 204-221, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09596526","","JCROE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166004219"

The core purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of corporate governance indexes on social responsibility and Shareholders' wealth maximization in the US firms. The current study employs a sample of 286 non-financial S&P 1500 listed firms from the year 2010–2020. The panel data for S&P 1500 index firms were collected from the Eikone data stream professional service terminal. Panel regression models with fixed and random effects were employed to investigate the proposed hypotheses. In addition, the problem of endogeneity was addressed by the dynamic GMM model. This study constructed an index score for the very first time to address CSR and shareholders' wealth. The results of the study revealed that board composition and board diversity support community development (CSR), but negatively impact global sustainability development (CSR index). However, the audit committee was found to have no impact on both CSR funds and Index. Moreover, the audit committee index (AC) and board diversity index (BC) were also found to significantly contribute to shareholders' wealth maximization, but the audit committee index does not support community development. Shareholder wealth was found to have a very weak relationship with the audit committee index. Our findings have significant implications especially for developed countries. The policymakers and legislators are suggested to employ diverse boards of directors with a balanced composition to enhance human welfare and community development. In addition, regulatory bodies should appoint skilled audit committee members and directors with diverse cultural backgrounds, qualifications and experience to protect common shareholders' interest. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Indexes; Corporate Governance; Csr; Dividend Policy; Economic And Social Effects; Random Processes; Regression Analysis; 'current; Board Index; Community Development; Corporate Governance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Dividend Policy; Moral Obligations; Panel Data; Social Responsibilities; Social Wealth; Shareholders","Economic and social effects; Random processes; Regression analysis; 'current; Board index; Community development; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Dividend policy; Moral obligations; Panel data; Social responsibilities; Social wealth; Shareholders","","","This research investigates the association between the corporate governance indexes (based on Board composition, audit committee, and board Diversity) and Dividend policy and CSR activities in the US non-financial listed firms. Panel data was collected from the professional portal Eikone data stream for S&P 1500 index firms between the year 2010 and 2020. Corporate governance indexes are focused (Independent) variables, while shareholders' wealth and corporate social responsibility are considered dependent variables. Sales revenue is considered a control variable, which is the main determinant of dividend and CSR activities. According to Brockman and Unlu (2009), sales revenue is the best predictor of dividends for maximum sample size and minimum error. Shareholder dividends are evaluated by corporate profits which ultimately depend upon sales of the business. Sheikh et al. (2021) state that dividends are efficiently scaled by sales in robust check. The distribution of CSR funds depends upon sales because it controls firm-specific dimensions such as the size of the firm. Larger sales enhance CSR funds allocations (Zhang et al., 2021). According to Kuzey et al. (2021) sales based performance measure visibility of CSR practices and the motivation of internal stakeholders and this indicator is better suited for corporate sectors comparative to others. Amini et al. (2017) stated that firms with higher level of revenues in United States are more engaged in CSR initiative. Previous studies incorporate total assets, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and leverage (Jiraporn and Chintrakarn, 2013; Mahoney and Thorn, 2006; Said et al., 2009). In contrast, Veronica Siregar and Bachtiar (2010) stated high leverage reduces CSR practices because of avoiding creditor scrutiny. According to Siminica et al. (2019) ROA positively impacts CSR but it does not necessarily make a contribution to a firm's CSR dimensions. Moreover, ROE positively influence CSR, but it is negatively affected by profitability rate. Furthermore, larger firms have no significant impact on CSR performance (Ting, 2021).At the first stage, about four variables were incorporated to construct each index. The reliability of constructed index was estimated by Cronbach's Alpha. To measure shareholders' wealth, dividend payouts and yield were employed as a proxy of the dependent variable, while corporate social responsibility was determined by the CSR index and funds allocated for the donation. The CSR index was further developed through sixteen sustainability development goals given by United Nations. The sample contained 286 non-financial firms with 3115 firm-year observations. US non-financial firms were selected purposively because of the modern corporate governance tools and regulations imposed in 2010 and later. In addition, missing data from the data stream portal was handled from their annual reports. Panel regression and dynamic GMM model were employed to estimate results. The following models were employed to investigate our proposed hypotheses.CSR is determined by the annual funds allocated for the social responsibility and charity under the head of donation (Payo & lee, 2013). In addition, study also asses the CSR by takes eleven items of sustainability development goals given by United Nation for the measuring CSR activities (Lu et al., 2021). (See Table 3)Sales revenues taken as the control variable in the all model. Funds allocated to the CSR and shareholders dividend both are depend upon the revenue generated by the sales in corporate sector (Azam et al., 2019).Bivariate analysis is presented in Table 2 which shows Pearson correlation, standard deviation and means of variables studied to investigate our hypotheses. A total of 3135 observations were based on eleven years with 286 cross sections. The initial idea of the relationship based on Pearson correlation shows a positive and significant relationship of dividend payout with BC index (r=0.179, p-value <0.05) and AC index (r=0.586, p-value <0.05). Dividend yield also has a positive and significant relationship with BC index (r=0.273, p-value <0.05) and DIV index (r=0.076, p-value <0.05). The results match the findings of previous studies (Naciti, 2019), proving our initial idea of shareholders’ wealth supported by BC index (Ilhan-Nas et al., 2018), DIV index (García-Meca et al., 2022) and AC index (Ofori-Sasu et al., 2022). In contrast, Dividend yield negatively and significantly correlated with BC index (r=-0.079, p-value <0.05). In addition, the BC index (r=0.139, p-value <0.05), AC index (r=0.143, p-value <0.05), and DIV index (r=0.051, p-value <0.05) also significantly correlated with funds allocated for CSR (donations). So, all corporate governance indexes were found to support the funds allocation for CSR. However, CSR index negatively and significantly correlated with board composition index (r=-0.123, p-value <0.05) and BC index (r=-0.072, p-value <0.05). The same findings were reported by Kahloul et al. (2022). The BC index and DIV index did not support CSR index, but CSR index was found to have a significant and positive relationship with AC index (r=0.043, p-value <0.05). Hence, our initial findings support the contribution of study (See Table 6).Model I and II determined the influence of board indexes on corporate social responsibility through funds allocated for CSR and CSR index, while Model II and IV investigated the influence of board indexes on shareholders’ wealth through dividend payout and dividend yield. H1 postulated a positive and significant impact of BC index on the funds allocated for CSR activities. The results in the pooled (β = 0.0089, p-value < 0.05), fixed (β = 0.0089, p-value < 0.05) and random effects (β = 0.0089, p-value < 0.05) proved to be significant, while board composition index found significant and negative relationship with CSR index in all instances (β = 0, p-value < 0.05). Hence H1 proved to be significant positively with CSR through donation, while negatively supports through CSR index. The larger composition of board size, board affiliations in industry, attendance of the board meetings, duality in the board, independent directors in the board and board meetings enhance the interest of common stakeholders such as employees and the general public. Findings are in favor of Stakeholder theory through board composition index.H2 predicted that DIV index has a significant impact on CSR activities. The same results were repeated for CSR funds and CSR index respectively. Diversity in the gender, experience and cultural background of corporate board was found to enhance the CSR funds in S&P 500 firms. So, the diversity index enhances the social wellbeing through the lens of cultural trait theory.H3 investigated the impact of AC index on corporate social responsibility. The results were found to be positive and significant for the CSR index (β = 0, p-value < 0.05) in pooled, fixed and random effects model. The higher audit committee independence, audit committee meetings, skills and education of audit committee was found to enhance CSR activities. Hence, the upper echelon theory was supported by audit committee skills and education, but the audit committee index had an insignificant relationship with CSR funds. The board composition index did not support dividend payout and dividend yield (β = 0, p < 0.05) in the fixed and random effect, therefore, H4 was rejected.Finally, H5 and H6 investigated the impact of BD index and the AC index on dividend policy. BC index proved to be significant for dividend payout and dividend yield in pooled, fixed and random effect models (β = 0, p < 0.05), hence H5 failed to reject. The higher diversity in experience, gender and cultural background of corporate board in S&P 500 index results in shareholders' wealth maximization, so shareholders’ theory is supported by BC index. AC index was also found to be significantly and positively associated with the dividend payout (β = 0, p < 0.05). Hence, H6 was also confirmed for S&P 1500 index (See Table 7).The AC index was found to have an insignificant impact on social responsibility in our study which is consistent with the previous findings (Al-ahdal et al., 2020). In addition, diversity and composition characteristics was found to be negatively associated with CSR index-based sustainability development goals. The results further reveal that diversity and composition do not favor global sustainability development. They may prefer local community development over global sustainability. In contrast, the audit committee index was found to have no significant support for both funds allocated in form of the donation and CSR index (Zalata et al., 2018).","Abbasi, Kaleemullah, Audit committees, female directors and the types of female and male financial experts: Further evidence, Journal of Business Research, 114, pp. 186-197, (2020); Agarwala, Nidhi, Does board independence influence CSR performance?

The primary purpose of this paper is to determine the amount of investment in each of the shares of the listed company and the time of purchase, holding or sale of shares to maximize total return and reduce investment risk. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the goals of the problem, a two-level combined intelligent method, such as a support vector machine, decision tree, network Bayesian, k-nearest neighbors and multilayer perceptron neural network as heterogeneous basic models of ensemble learning in the first level, was applied. Then, the majority vote method (weighted average) in the second stage as the final model of learning was collectively used. Therefore, the data collected from 208 listed companies active in the Tehran stock exchange (http://tsetmc.com) from 2011 to 2015 have been used to teach the data. For testing and analysis, the data of the same companies between 2016 and 2020 have been used. Findings: The results showed that the method of combined ensemble learning and genetics has the highest total stock portfolio yield of 114.12%, with a risk of 0.905%. Also, by examining the rate of return on capital, it was observed that the proposed method has the highest average rate of return on investment of 110.64%. As a result, the proposed method leads to higher returns with lower risk than the purchase and maintenance method for fund managers and companies and predicts market trends. Research limitations/implications: In the forthcoming research, there were no limitations to obtain research data were easily extracted from the site of Tehran Stock Exchange Technology Management Company and Rahvard Novin software, and simulation was performed in MATLAB software. Practical implications: In this paper, using combined machine learning methods, companies’ stock prices are predicted and stock portfolio optimization is optimized. As companies and private organizations are trying to increase their rate of return, so they need a way to predict stock prices based on specific indicators. It turned out that this algorithm has the highest stock portfolio return with reasonable investment risk, and therefore, investors, portfolio managers and market timers can be used this method to optimize the stock portfolio. Social implications: The homogeneous and heterogeneous two-level hybrid model presented in the research can be used to predict market trends by market timers and fund managers. Also, adjusting the portfolio with this method has a much higher return than the return on buying and holding, and with controlled risk, it increases the security of investors’ capital, and investors invest their capital in the funds more safely. And will achieve their expected returns. As a result, the psychological security gained from using this method for portfolio arrangement will eventually lead to the growth of the capital market. Originality/value: This paper tries to present the best combination of stock portfolios of active companies of the Tehran Stock Exchange by using the two-level combined intelligent method and genetic algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Combined Learning Methods; Ensemble Learning; Market Timing; Portfolio Balancing","","","","","Portfolio Preservation During Severe Market Corrections A Market Timing Enhancement to Modern Portfolio Theory, (2014); Andersson, Tommy Daniel G., Balancing value and risk within a city's event portfolio: an explorative study of DMO professionals' assessments, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 11, 4, pp. 413-432, (2020); Appelbe, Trent W., Econometric modelling of Canadian long distance calling: A comparison of aggregate time series versus point-to-point panel data approaches, Empirical Economics, 17, 1, pp. 125-140, (1992); Ballings, Michel, Evaluating multiple classifiers for stock price direction prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 20, pp. 7046-7056, (2015); Bigerna, Simona, Balancing energy security priorities: portfolio optimization approach to oil imports, Applied Economics, 53, 5, pp. 555-574, (2021); Boado-Penas, M.

Political Corruption and Corporate Finance is the first attempt to scrutinize the effect of political corruption on corporate finance. It provides readers with a comprehensive overview of corruption-related issues and theoretical and empirical studies in corporate finance. This book summarizes the causes and effects of political corruption as well as anti-corruption mechanisms and initiatives; analyzes how political corruption at both state and local levels determines corporate financial decisions (investment, financing, and dividend); and discusses how the corruption environment determines firm-level financial behavior. The first three chapters of the book introduce political corruption, the status of political corruption, and anti-corruption campaigns around the world. The last three chapters focus on how firms make financial decisions, and the role of political corruption in corporate finance.

On the example of the construction industry, the article tests the approach based on WACC and WARA analyses. The risk and profitability of the specified markets were analyzed based on the Efficient Frontier method. The Polish market and the group of Euronext markets were selected for comparison. The necessity of calculation of WARA based on only significant assets was determined. The differentiation between WARA and WACC in the Polish construction market can be overcome by maximizing goodwill and intangible assets and minimizing tangible assets. It reveals problems not in the stock market, but in the industry and the economy as a whole, particularly the lack of functioning markets such as the stock market for individual assets. The role of intangibles is different for Euronext markets. On the other hand, the requirement of the international accounting standards to transfer goodwill from assets to ""other income"" in case of a negative value (bad will) makes adequate consideration of goodwill in the WARA model virtually impossible. Another problem is a calculation of relative weights of assets in conditions of occurrence of both positive and negative values, which creates prerequisites for different approaches and interpretations.

The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the growth of bad debts of commercial banks on loans is currently the most acute problem. The dynamics of the volume of overdue debt on loans from commercial banks of the Russian Federation for 2012–2021 was analyzed. In the course of the study, it was revealed that the volume of bad debts is influenced both by internal factors, such as poor management of the loan portfolio, and by external factors, such as abrupt changes in the level of inflation, the growth of the exchange rate, etc. In order to study the influence of factorial signs on the effective sign-the growth rate of overdue debts, a correlation-regression model was compiled. In addition to the effective feature Y-the growth rate of overdue debt, the model included such factorial features as: X1-the growth rate of GDP per capita, X2-the growth rate of the average per capita income of the population, X3-the growth rate of foreign trade surplus, X4-inflation index, X5 is the growth rate of capital outflow, X6-is the growth rate of cash, X7-is the interest rate on loans, X8-is the US dollar exchange rate, X9-is the price of a barrel of oil URLS dollars, X10-is the growth of wages. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai-system; Correlation-regression Model; Financial Risk; Npl Forecast; Overdue Debt; Perceptron; Economic Analysis; Finance; Forecasting; International Trade; Population Statistics; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Ai Systems; Commercial Bank; Correlation-regression Model; Exchange Rates; Finance Risks; Financial Risks; Npl Forecast; Overdue Debt; Regression Modelling; Theoretical Foundations; Growth Rate","Economic analysis; Finance; Forecasting; International trade; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; AI systems; Commercial bank; Correlation-regression model; Exchange rates; Finance risks; Financial risks; NPL forecast; Overdue debt; Regression modelling; Theoretical foundations; Growth rate","","","The research was financed as part of the project ""Development of a methodology for instrumental base formation for analysis and modelling of the spatial socio-economic development of systems based on internal reserves in the context of digitalization"" (FSEG-2023–0008).","Overview of the Banking Sector this Number of the Review Corresponds to Methodological Comments on the Tables of the Review Issue 20 of the Russian Federation Online Version Analytical Indicators, (2022); How Russia Ended Up on the Brink of A Financial Disaster Comparable to, (1998); Lending in Russia Debt; Bataev, Alexey V., Comparative analysis of the use of neural network technology in the world and Russia, pp. 70-81, (2019); Bril, Alexander R., Small innovative company's valuation within venture capital financing of projects in the construction industry, MATEC Web of Conferences, 106, (2017); Demidova, Svetlana E., Features of segmentation and positioning processes when creating an educational brand in neural network economy, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, (2020); Ilin, Igor V., Analysis of Factors, Defining Software Development Approach, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 692, pp. 1306-1314, (2018); Titov, Aleksandr B., Complex Monitoring Systems for Landfills, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 220, pp. 385-393, (2021); Goncharova, Natalia L., Development of Financial Service Methods for People with Dementia During Digitalization: A Partnership Between Citizens and the Russian State, International Journal of Technology, 11, 8, pp. 1547-1556, (2020); Bataev, Alexey V., Evaluation of the Economic Efficiency of Blockchain for Customer Identification by Financial Institutions, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 940, 1, (2020)","Ilin, I.; Kudryavtseva, T.; Petrova, M.M.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","International Scientific Conference on Digital Transformation on Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Service, DTMIS 2022","","St. Petersburg","299459","23673389; 23673370","9789819652372; 9783031931055; 9789819662968; 9783031999963; 9783031950162; 9783031947698; 9783032004406; 9783031910074; 9783031926105; 9789819639410","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169011719"

The Google Search Volume Index (GSVI) is used to evaluate the attention parameter. In a global setting, made by 2941 stocks in both advanced and emerging economies between 2006 and 2019, we revealed that attention to climate change helps investors to have a significantly positive effect on returns of stocks with high ESG scores compared to low sustainable stocks. Moreover, we observe an interesting changing in the relationship between corporate social performance and people attention, when deepening the analysis from the perspective of sectorial distribution.

This study is based on the data sample composed of complete individual financial statements (audited if available) of firms conducting their business in the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2018 and belonging to the automotive supply chain. This supply chain is defined as (sub) deliveries of the Czech automotive industry represented mainly by companies classified under NACE 22, 27, 25, 24. The hypothesis claiming that the investment and leverage-based variables are the important drivers of operating profitability was only partly confirmed (valid predominantly for Tier 3), which shows that the supply chain organization also plays a crucial role as well as (valid for Tier 1). Also, we have shown (illustrated) that the assumption of different capital structures among tiers is valid. The average overall indebtedness of Tier 3 is higher by approximately 50% (altogether, the short-and long-term leverage are higher by 40% and 62% respectively) than Tier 1 firms. The need for relatively high capital expenditures (applicable to Tier 1) and working capital investments (applicable to Tier 3) is partly facilitated by external funds reflected in the indebtedness, which is associated with the costs reducing overall low profits from these investments. The leverage-profitability relationship seems to be nonlinear for long-term debts contrary to short-term debts where the linear relationship prevails. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automotive Supply Chain; Car Manufacturing; External Financing; Profitability","","","","","Ahn, Seoungpil, Leverage and investment in diversified firms, Journal of Financial Economics, 79, 2, pp. 317-337, (2006); Alsaleh, Mohd, Determinants of cost efficiency of bioenergy industry: Evidence from EU28 countries, Renewable Energy, 127, pp. 746-762, (2018); Arora, Akhil, Design standardization of unit operations for reducing the capital intensity and cost of small-scale chemical processes, AIChE Journal, 66, 2, (2020); Beck, Nathaniel L., What to do (and not to do) with time-series cross-section data, American Political Science Review, 89, 3, pp. 634-647, (1995); Bena, Jan, Financial development and the allocation of external finance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 19, 1, pp. 1-25, (2012); Brusco, Sandro, Internal financing, managerial compensation and multiple tasks, Annals of Finance, 16, 4, pp. 501-527, (2020); Chang, Chongchuo, Cash conversion cycle and corporate performance: Global evidence, International Review of Economics and Finance, 56, pp. 568-581, (2018); Coad, Alex, Growth processes of Italian manufacturing firms, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 22, 1, pp. 54-70, (2011); Supplier Database Classification, (2021); Indian Journal of Economics and Development, (2016)","","Technical University of Liberec","","","","","","12123609","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161853944"

The paper also aims to identify the most important predictors of financial distress pre- and mid-pandemic. Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge toll, not only on human lives but also on many businesses. This provided the impetus to assess the impact of the pandemic on the financial status of Jordanian companies. Methodology The initial sample comprised 165 companies, which was cleansed and reduced to 84 companies as per data availability. Financial data pertaining to the 84 companies were collected over a two-year period, 2019 and 2020, to empirically quantify the impact of the pandemic on companies in the dataset. Two approaches were employed. The first approach involved using Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) based on Altman’s (1968) model to obtain the Z-score of each company over the investigation period. The second approach involved developing models using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with 15 standard financial ratios to find out the most important variables in predicting financial distress and create an accurate Financial Distress Prediction (FDP) model. Contribution This research contributes by providing a better understanding of how financial distress predictors perform during dynamic and risky times. The research confirmed that in spite of the negative impact of COVID-19 on the financial health of companies, the main predictors of financial distress remained relatively steadfast. This indicates that standard financial distress predictors can be regarded as being impervious to extraneous financial and/or health calamities. Findings Results using MDA indicated that more than 63% of companies in the dataset have a lower Z-score in 2020 when compared to 2019. There was also an 8% increase in distressed companies in 2020, and around 6% of companies came to be no longer healthy. As for the models built using ANNs, results show that the most important variable in predicting financial distress is the Return on Capital. The predictive accuracy for the 2019 and 2020 models measured using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graph was 87.5% and 97.6%, respectively. Recommendations Decision makers and top management are encouraged to focus on the identified for Practitioners highly liquid ratios to make thoughtful decisions and initiate preemptive actions to avoid organizational failure. Recommendations This research can be considered a stepping stone to investigating the impact of for Researchers COVID-19 on the financial status of companies. Researchers are recommended to replicate the methods used in this research across various business sectors to understand the financial dynamics of companies during uncertain times. Impact on Society Stakeholders in Jordanian-listed companies should concentrate on the list of most important predictors of financial distress as presented in this study. Future Research Future research may focus on expanding the scope of this study by including other geographical locations to check for the generalisability of the results. Future research may also include post-COVID-19 data to check for changes in results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ann; Covid-19; Financial Distress Prediction; Jordan; Mda; Decision Making; Discriminant Analysis; Electronic Trading; Financial Markets; Forecasting; Neural Networks; Amman Stock Exchanges; Data Availability; Financial Data; Financial Distress; Financial Distress Prediction; Financial Health; Human Lives; Jordan; Multiple Discriminant Analysis; Z-scores; Covid-19","Decision making; Discriminant analysis; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Neural networks; Amman stock exchanges; Data availability; Financial data; Financial distress; Financial distress prediction; Financial health; Human lives; Jordan; Multiple discriminant analysis; Z-scores; COVID-19","","","","Journal of Accounting Finance Management Strategy, (2020); Proceedings of the 15th Ibpsa Conference, (2017); Journal of Entrepreneurship Education, (2022); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z- Score and ZETA® models, pp. 428-455, (2013); Altman, Edward I., Financial Distress Prediction in an International Context: A Review and Empirical Analysis of Altman's Z-Score Model, Journal of International Financial Management and Accounting, 28, 2, pp. 131-171, (2017); Ansari, Abdollah, A hybrid metaheuristic method in training artificial neural network for bankruptcy prediction, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 176640-176650, (2020); Ashraf, Badar Nadeem, Stock markets’ reaction to COVID-19: Cases or fatalities?, Research in International Business and Finance, 54, (2020); Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); Journal of Accounting Research, (1966)","","Informing Science Institute","","","","","","15551229; 15551237","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159897448"

The study utilises a sample of 181 listed GCC firms over the period from 2010 to 2016. Board personal attributes, including board expertise, age, gender, and nationality are investigated along with some other board issues such as; board size, meetings, and independence. Panel data analysis with fixed and random effect models are conducted to estimate the results. The results reveal that companies with large board size and greater age have less FRQ. Further, the results report that institutional founders, higher board independence, and expertise associate with greater levels of FRQ. The results also find that board meetings and family founders negatively influence FRQ. However, female directors, foreign directors, and royal board members setting in the board did not contribute to the levels of FRQ in the sampled companies. Finally, the results indicate that companies with a CEO royal member have higher levels of FRQ however, companies with chair board royals have less levels of FRQ. This research has valuable implications for investors, board of directors, analysts, academicians, and policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Attributes; Board Diversity; Financial Reporting Quality; Gcc; Royal Directors; Family Structure; Finance; Industrial Enterprise","family structure; finance; industrial enterprise","","","","Alahdal, Waleed M., Corporate characteristics and leverage: evidence from Gulf countries, PSU Research Review, 6, 2, pp. 120-140, (2022); Abdallah, Abed Al Nasser, Corporate governance practices, ownership structure, and corporate performance in the GCC countries, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 46, pp. 98-115, (2017); Aggarwal, Reena, Does governance travel around the world?

We formalize low-carbon mean-variance portfolio strategies by integrating a carbon penalty to a constrained mean-variance optimization framework. We resort to direct and indirect emissions, split between Scopes 1–2 and Scope 3, across geographical zones (Europe and US) and data providers (Refinitiv and Carbon4 Finance). Our results show that it is possible to cut emission intensities in half at least with virtually no loss in Sharpe ratio for reasonable levels of the carbon constraint. These results are valid across various choices of risk aversions, and irrespective of emissions data provider. For a sustainability-aware investor, these low-carbon portfolios are associated to a higher level of welfare. We find that the corresponding allocations are shifted towards assets with higher returns while keeping the portfolio's volatility unchanged. Our results add to the literature contending that sustainable investing is not costly. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Environmental Finance; Impact Investing; Portfolio Footprint; Scope 3 Emissions; Sustainable Investing","","","","We are grateful for the feedback and suggestions of Sushanta Mallick (Editor), Sabri Boubaker (Guest Editor) and two anonymous referees, which helped us substantially improve the presentation and the empirical part of the paper.

However, there remain several important research design considerations that must be accounted for over the process of planning, executing, and writing event studies. Because of this, many issues and sources of uncertainty emerge among students and early researchers. There is a need for a comprehensive guide to these common issues and how to address them, delving into the nuances and steps to take. Applied Guide for Event Study Research in Supply Chain Management supports graduate students and researchers to understand how to develop, execute, and publish event studies, specifically in the area of supply chain management, with valuable support for wider management studies. This book anticipates many reviewer and editorial concerns and questions and explores how to design a study that addresses issues before they arise, or how to tackle the issue during the review process.

It is found that the development of digital finance has a structural driving effect on the value of strategic emerging enterprises. It shows that the driving impact caused by the depth of use of digital finance is more evident than the coverage of digital finance. At the same time, it is more apparent in the low degree of marketization, nonstate-owned enterprises, and central and western regions, highlighting the inclusive characteristics of digital finance. Mechanistic research shows that digital finance can enhance the value of strategic emerging enterprises through three paths: supplementary funds, reducing risk, and promoting innovation, thereby realizing a sustainable society.

During its 13-month listing on NASDAQ, Luckin suffered at least seven short selling attacks. These attacks, although unsuccessful until Luckin's own confession of fraud, led to Luckin's subsequent delisting and created an adverse chain reaction in two related companies. Despite this setback, Luckin took a turn for the better in terms of revenue and survived the scandal. In this study, we examine short seller behavior in attacking Luckin and discuss why attacks can be repetitive. We find that after short sellers explicitly announce their intent, the return comovement of related companies increases. Moreover, we show that short selling is highly risky, as ill-timed attacks can cause large losses due to a short squeeze. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Fraud; Short Seller Behavior; Short Selling Attack; Short Squeeze","","","","Funding text 1: Zhe Peng would like to thank Phelim Boyle and Yong Qiang Chen for critical comments on an earlier draft.

While we find consistent with previous evidence that asymmetric information between acquirers and targets significantly influences the choice of M&A payment methods, we show that contrary to prevailing findings in the literature, acquirers cannot exploit their overvaluation through stock-financed M&A at targets’ disadvantage. In addition, when facing larger uncertainty in the counterparty’s valuation, a higher ratio of cash is applied in M&A payment.

We take the instrumental variable approach and confirm this causal relationship. Investors from jurisdictions with strong corporate governance and those committed to the principles of responsible investment have greater monitoring effects. Greater cultural distance undermines these effects. The disciplinary role of foreign ownership is stronger in firms with weak governance and low information transparency. Foreign investors reduce corporate excess perks and thereby improve the operational performance. We focus on foreign investors to investigate the role of international owners in China, a host country with relatively weak corporate governance; future research can consider host countries with strong corporate governance. Consequently, we bring space and process to the forefront of the research agenda on perks in the international business literature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Perquisite Consumption; Foreign Ownership; International Corporate Finance","","","","We are grateful to Editor Lemma W.

Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors’ appointment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Of Directors; Female Tenure; Gender Diversity; R&d","","","","","Adams, Renée B., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 94, 2, pp. 291-309, (2009); Alhababsah, Salem, Does shared tenure between audit committee chair and engagement partner affect audit outcomes?

In contrast to most prior studies that observed how employees perceive their incentive plans, this paper focuses on whether employee participation in the design of performance measures will increase the sensitivity of reward-effortand result in better branch performance. On the basis of some branch-level sample data provided by the largest real estate brokerage company in Taiwan from 2010-2016, we found that when branch managers were allowed to offer their opinions on the design of performance measures, there was an increase in the sensitivity of the bonus to the fees paid to the headquarters besides an improvement in the performance of the branch offices, compared with the situation when using a statistical approach that identified controllable and non-controllable KPIs. These results provide evidence that allowing subordinates to express their voice in the development of performance measures makes it more likely that incentive pay will reflect employee efforts. Moreover, empirical evidence also indicates that giving employees the opportunity to express their opinions whiledesigning their incentive plans can increase the sensitivity of reward-effort and motivate them to improve branch performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Branch Performance; Performance Measures; Reward-effort Sensitivity","","","","","Abdel-Wahab, Mohamed S., Trends of skills and productivity in the UK construction industry, Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 15, 4, pp. 372-382, (2008); Journal of Real Estate Research, (1990); Abernethy, Margaret A., Determinants of accounting innovation implementation, Abacus, 41, 3, pp. 217-240, (2005); Abernethy, Margaret A., Determinants of control system design in divisionalized firms, Accounting Review, 79, 3, pp. 545-570, (2004); Abernethy, Margaret A., The role of performance measures in the intertemporal decisions of business unit managers, Contemporary Accounting Research, 30, 3, pp. 925-961, (2013); Adams, Mike B., Managerial discretion and voluntary disclosure: Empirical evidence from the New Zealand life insurance industry, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 17, 3, pp. 245-281, (1998); Accounting Review, (1988); International Business Research, (2016); Ang, James S., Ascertaining the effects of employee bonus plans, Applied Economics, 37, 12, pp. 1439-1448, (2005); Aranda, Carmen, Ratcheting and the role of relative target setting, Accounting Review, 89, 4, pp. 1197-1226, (2014)","","Journal Of Accounting Review","","","","","","10181687","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144107407"

It therefore uses the dataset pertaining to China from most recent time-series–covering the period spanning from the years of 1990 to 2020, by employing the Morlet Wavelet Analysis technique. The empirical findings of the wavelet power spectrum reveal that green finance GF and ER are vulnerable in the short- and long-run, and the short-run, respectively. At the same time, no vulnerability has been observed in the GDP, PR, and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. In addition to this, the wavelet coherence also reveals the bidirectional causal association that exists between GF-CO<inf>2</inf> and ER-CO<inf>2</inf>, but only in the short run. It must also be taken into consideration that the causal influence of CO<inf>2</inf> is deemed to be greater than the GF and ER, respectively. Besides this, a bidirectional causal nexus also exists between the GDP and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, only in the long run. Furthermore, the association between the economic growths follows both the phase and antiphase associations. Moreover, the study also reveals that there is no significant causal link between the PR and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The results emphasize that the significance of green finance investment will tend to increase with strict policy implications, stabilization or minimization of economic risk and political risk. The same will also take place while promoting environmentally friendly production via economic growth, so as to reduce CO<inf>2</inf> emission in the region taken into account. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Emission; D25; D81; Economic Growth; Economic Risk; G32; Green Finance; O44; Political Risk; Q50; Wavelet; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Economic Impact; Emissions Trading; Environmental Economics; Environmental Risk; Risk Assessment; Time Series Analysis; China","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic impact; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental risk; risk assessment; time series analysis; China","","","","Abbasi, Kashif Raza, Do energy use and economic policy uncertainty affect CO2 emissions in China?

Drawing on the VoD literature and on business angel research, we retrospectively study two contrastive cases of success and failure of French start-ups operating in the IT sector over a period of two and nine years, respectively, by taking the dyadic relationship between business angels and entrepreneurs as unit of analysis. We document the business angels' trust evolution over time and we show how trust shifts facilitate or damage the entrepreneurs' journey through the VoD. We offer a process-model of sustaining business angels’ trust in entrepreneur-business angel relationships to cross the VoD, thus addressing recent calls for more in-depth examinations of social aspects in investment and post-investment business angel research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Angel; Exit; Financial Resources; Investment; Reinvestment; Trust; Valley Of Death; Social Aspects; Video On Demand; Business Angels; Dyadic Relationship; Process Modeling; Trust Evolution; Unit Of Analysis; Investments","Social aspects; Video on demand; Business angels; Dyadic relationship; Process Modeling; Trust evolution; Unit of analysis; Investments","","","New product development literature sheds light on the nature and stages of the VoD by showing how various external resource providers, including government support and financing partners, help entrepreneurs and their companies in the process of converting inventions into innovations ( Biemans and Huizingh, 2020 ; Bonnin Roca and O'Sullivan, 2020 ; Corsatea, 2014 ; Islam et al., 2018 ; Tassey, 2014 ; Weyant, 2011 ). The conversion of inventions into innovations requires market recognition and fit, along with a capacity to demonstrate potential and transfer. Evidence exists that important internal and external resources are necessary to start-ups throughout this challenging process ( Koen et al., 2001 ; Schoonmaker et al., 2012 ; Smith and Reinertsen, 1991 ). New product development literature emphasizes the importance of innovation ecosystems for assisting entrepreneurs, researchers and inventors in crossing the VoD by either reducing its duration ( Jucevicius et al., 2016 ) or by providing access to external resources ( Islam, 2017 ). The internal organizational process enabling companies to bridge the VoD was labelled the “Fuzzy Front End of Innovation” ( Schoonmaker et al., 2012 ; Smith and Reinertsen, 1991 ). According to Auerswald and Branscomb (2003) , the Fuzzy Front End of innovation comprises five main stages: research, invention, early stage technology development, product development and commercialization. Each stage comprises critical needs of financial resources that must be met by particular financial resource providers in order to enable project leaders and entrepreneurs to convert research into commercially successful products and services. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and corporate research help projects pass from the research stage to the invention stage. Business angels, corporations, technology labs and Small Business Innovation Research programs (SBIR) enable projects to pass from the invention stage to early stage technology development and product development. Finally, venture capital, corporate venture funds, equity and commercial debt help projects to reach the final stage, that of commercialization. Even though each financial resource provider can be involved in any stage of the VoD, they are particularly prone to play a role during one specific stage of the VoD, as indicated in Fig. 1 , adapted from Markham (2002a) and Auerswald and Branscomb (2003) . Fig. 1 indicates when financial resource providers tend to invest more frequently in order to allow companies to pass successfully from one stage to the next.","Academy of Management Annals, (2008); Alaszewski, Andy M., Uncertainty in everyday life: Risk, worry and trust, Health, Risk and Society, 11, 3, pp. 201-207, (2009); Academy of Management Review, (1994); Amatucci, Frances M., Women entrepreneurs securing business angel financing: Tales from the field, Venture Capital, 6, 2-3, pp. 181-196, (2004); Management Science, (1990); Argote, Linda M., Organizational learning: From experience to knowledge, Organization Science, 22, 5, pp. 1123-1137, (2011); Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, (2003); Auerswald, Philip E., Valleys of death and Darwinian seas: Financing the invention to innovation transition in the United States, Journal of Technology Transfer, 28, 3-4, pp. 227-239, (2003); Avdeitchikova, Sofia, On the structure of the informal venture capital market in Sweden: Developing investment roles, Venture Capital, 10, 1, pp. 55-85, (2008); Avdeitchikova, Sofia, What do we mean when we talk about business angels?

However, how urbanization affects urban residential building carbon emissions is still unclear. This study adopts the panel threshold regression model to explore the dynamic influence mechanism of the urbanization on urban residential building CO<inf>2</inf> emissions based on the evidence from China's 30 provincial regions during 2000–2015. Results indicate that urbanization contributes positively to the increase of urban residential building CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, while such degree of influence varies across different stages of income and energy structure. As for per capita income, the promoting effect of the urbanization on urban residential building CO<inf>2</inf> emissions is enhanced with the growth of per capita income. And the degree of such increasing effect becomes greater when per capita income exceeds its threshold value. Regarding the energy mix, the driving effect of urbanization on urban residential building CO<inf>2</inf> emissions is also strengthened when the energy mix crosses its threshold value, showing a “stepwise growth” feature. This study reveals the nonlinear influence mechanism of urbanization on urban building CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and this is helpful in boosting the related theoretical and practical exploration on the impact of urbanization on the environment. Based on our findings, an environmentally-friendly consumption pattern should be promoted and more penetration of cleaner energies should be improved in urban households, which will be effective to alleviate the increase of residential carbon emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon Emissions; China; Panel Threshold Model; Stirpat Model; Urban Residential Buildings; Urbanization; Carbon; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Housing; Regression Analysis; Carbon Mitigation; Consumption Patterns; Energy Structures; Increasing Effect; Influence Mechanism; Per Capita Income; Threshold Regression Models; Urban Residential Buildings; Urban Growth; Carbon; Anthropogenic Source; Building; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Emission; Nonlinearity; Numerical Model; Regression Analysis; Urbanization; Article; Carbon Footprint; China; Data Analysis; Energy Consumption; Environmental Impact; Environmental Policy; Model; Personal Income; Priority Journal","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Housing; Regression analysis; Carbon mitigation; Consumption patterns; Energy structures; Increasing effect; Influence mechanism; Per capita income; Threshold regression models; Urban residential buildings; Urban growth; carbon; anthropogenic source; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; nonlinearity; numerical model; regression analysis; urbanization; Article; carbon footprint; China; data analysis; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental policy; model; personal income; priority journal","","carbon, 7440-44-0","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71902053 and 71722004 ), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2020CDJSK03XK15 ), National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFD1100201 ).","Alkhathlan, Khalid M., Energy consumption, carbon emissions and economic growth in saudi arabia: An aggregate and disaggregate analysis, Energy Policy, 62, pp. 1525-1532, (2013); Al-Mulali, Usama, Electricity consumption from renewable and non-renewable sources and economic growth: Evidence from Latin American countries, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 30, pp. 290-298, (2014); Bekhet, Hussain Ali, Impact of urbanization growth on Malaysia CO2 emissions: Evidence from the dynamic relationship, Journal of Cleaner Production, 154, pp. 374-388, (2017); Chen, Yizhong, Tradeoffs in cost competitiveness and emission reduction within microgrid sustainable development considering price-based demand response, Science of the Total Environment, 703, (2020); Chen, Yizhong, Impact of unconventional natural gas development on regional water resources and market supply in China from the perspective of game analysis, Energy Policy, 145, (2020); Cole, Matthew A., Examining the impact of demographic factors on air pollution, Population and Environment, 26, 1, pp. 5-21, (2004); Cole, Matthew A., The environmental Kuznets curve: An empirical analysis, Environment and Development Economics, 2, 4, pp. 401-416, (1997); Cramer, James C., Population growth and air quality in California, Demography, 35, 1, pp. 45-56, (1998); Population and Development Review, (2002); Cramer, James C., Lost in the ozone: Population growth and ozone in California, Population and Environment, 21, 3, pp. 315-338, (2000)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","00489697; 18791026","","STEVA","33770864","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100701985"

We used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision tree methods to model the decision-making process. The proposed model was validated on a case study of multiple construction projects. The assessment was performed from individual investor’s and independent expert’s perspectives. The criteria for the assessment were selected according to the principles of sustainability. We performed the sensitivity analysis, making it possible to assess the possible changes of the decisions depending on the potential patterns of the decision-makers’ behaviour. The results of the study show that, sometimes, small fluctuations in the project factors affect the project selection indicating the possible lack of the robustness of the project decisions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Construction Projects; Decision Robustness; Decision Tree; Project Assessment; Sensitivity Analysis; Sustainability Criteria; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Decision Making; Project Assessment; Stakeholder","analytical hierarchy process; decision making; project assessment; stakeholder","","","Funding: This research was funded by Vilnius Gediminas Technical University.","Issa, Usama Hamed, Evaluation and selection of construction projects based on risk analysis, Structures, 27, pp. 361-370, (2020); Edjossan-Sossou, Abla Mimi, Sustainable risk management strategy selection using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 45, (2020); Agreeing on Robust Decisions New Processes for Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty, (2014); Bugajev, Andrej, An algorithm for modelling the impact of the judicial conflict-resolution process on construction investment, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 1, (2018); Khan, Abdul Salam, A trade-off analysis of economic and environmental aspects of a disruption based closed-loop supply chain network, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 17, (2020); Pedersen, Simen, Economic gain vs. ecological pain-environmental sustainability in economies based on renewable biological resources, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 9, (2020); Pashaei Kamali, Farahnaz, Sustainability assessment of agricultural systems: The validity of expert opinion and robustness of a multi-criteria analysis, Agricultural Systems, 157, pp. 118-128, (2017); Muñoz-Medina, Belén, Sensitivity Analysis of Multicriteria Decision Making Methodology Developed for Selection of Typologies of Earth-retaining Walls in an Urban Highway, Transportation Research Procedia, 18, pp. 135-139, (2016); Roles in Construction Projects Analysis and Terminology, (2001); Construction Project Management Planning Scheduling and Controlling, (1998)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106597493"

The purpose of this study is to develop a more accurate and stable business failure prediction model by using a majority voting ensemble method with a decision tree (DT) with experimental data on US restaurant between 1980 and 2017. According to the diversity principle and individual optimized principle, DT and logit were selected as basic learning algorithms for the voting ensemble of business failure prediction. Three models, including an entire period (EP) model, an economic downturn (ED) model, and an economic expansion (EE) model, were developed by using WEKA 3.9. The prediction accuracy of the models were 88.02% for the EP model, 80.81% for the ED model, and 87.02 % for the EE model. While the EE model revealed the market capitalization, operating cash flow after interest and dividends (OCFAID), cash conversion cycle (CCC), return on capital employed (ROCE), accumulated retained earnings, stock price, and Tobin's Q as significant variables, the ED model exposed quite different variables such as OCFAID, KZ index, stock price, and CCC. The EP model combined most of the variables from two sub-divided models except for Tobin's Q, stock price, and debt to equity (D/E) ratio. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, this is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the financial and market-driven variables in the context of predicting restaurant failure, especially during economic recessions. This research has employed several accounting-based measures, market-based variables, and a macro-economic factor to improve the relevance and effectiveness of prediction models. And second, by using an ensemble model with a DT, it has improved both the interpretability of the results and the prediction accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bankruptcy; Business Failure Prediction; Decision Tree (dt); Economic Downturns; Ensemble; Financial Distress; Macro-economic Factor; Majority Voting; Prediction Accuracy; Restaurant Failure Prediction","","","","","Pakistan Journal of Commerce and Social Sciences, (2008); Alfaro-Cortés, Esteban, Bankruptcy forecasting: An empirical comparison of AdaBoost and neural networks, Decision Support Systems, 45, 1, pp. 110-122, (2008); Alfaro-Cortés, Esteban, Linear discriminant analysis versus adaboost for failure forecasting, Revista Espanola de Financiacion y Contabilidad, 37, 137, pp. 13-32, (2008); Almeida, Heitor V., The cash flow sensitivity of cash, Journal of Finance, 59, 4, pp. 1777-1804, (2004); Corporate Financial Distress and Bankruptcy, (1993); Ben-Amor, Souhir, Forecasting electricity spot price for Nord Pool market with a hybrid k-factor GARMA–LLWNN model, Journal of Forecasting, 37, 8, pp. 832-851, (2018); Andrade, Gregor, New evidence and perspectives on mergers, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15, 2, pp. 103-120, (2001); Andriosopoulos, Dimitris, Prediction of open market share repurchases and portfolio returns: evidence from France, Germany and the UK, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 46, 2, pp. 387-416, (2016); Corporate Collapse the Causes and Symptoms, (1976); Accountancy, (1983)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","25307614; 2444569X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100449727"

Design/methodology/approach: This paper gathers information from 106 published articles that contain corporate failure prediction models. The focus of the analysis is on the elements needed to design corporate failure prediction models (definition of failure, sample approach, prediction methods, variables and evaluation metrics and performance). The in-depth review creates a synthesis of current trends, from the view of those elements. Findings: Both consensus and divergences emerge regarding the design of corporate failure prediction models. On the one hand, authors agree about the use of bankruptcy as a definition of failure and that at least two evaluation metrics are needed to examine model performance for each class, individually and in general. On the other hand, they disagree about data collection procedures. Although several explanatory variables have been considered, all of them serve as complements for the primarily used financial information. Finally, the selection of prediction methods depends entirely on the research objective. These discrepancies suggest fundamental advances in discovery and establish valuable ideas for further research. Originality/value: This paper reveals some caveats and provides extensive, comprehensible guidelines for corporate failure prediction, which researchers can leverage as they continue to investigate this critical financial subject. It also suggests fruitful directions to develop further experiments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Failure; Finance; Financial Distress; Literature Review","","","","The authors are very grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their substantial contribution to the improvement of this paper.","Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., Modelling credit risk for SMEs: Evidence from the U.S. market, Abacus, 43, 3, pp. 332-357, (2007); Amankwah-Amoah, Joseph, Where will the axe fall?: An integrative framework for understanding attributions after a business failure, European Business Review, 27, 4, pp. 409-429, (2015); Amankwah-Amoah, Joseph, An integrative process model of organisational failure, Journal of Business Research, 69, 9, pp. 3388-3397, (2016); Corporate Collapse the Causes and Symptoms, (1976); Atiya, Amir F., Bankruptcy prediction for credit risk using neural networks: A survey and new results, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 12, 4, pp. 929-935, (2001); Balcaen, Sofie, 35 years of studies on business failure: An overview of the classic statistical methodologies and their related problems, British Accounting Review, 38, 1, pp. 63-93, (2006); Barniv, Ran Ron, Confidence intervals for controlling the probability of bankruptcy, Omega (United Kingdom), 28, 5, pp. 555-565, (2000); Journal of Accounting Research, (1966); Beaver, William H., Have financial statements become less informative?

Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected for 43 professional football clubs competing in the EPL and Championship for the financial year ends 2002–2019. Analysis was conducted using the Z-score methodology and additional statistical tests were conducted to measure differences between groups. Data was split into two distinct periods to analyse club finances pre- and post-FFP. Findings: The results show significant cases of financial distress amongst clubs in both divisions and that Championship clubs are in significantly poorer financial health than EPL clubs. In some cases, financially sustainability has worsened post-FFP. The “big 6” clubs – due to their size – seem to be more financially sound than the rest of the EPL, thus preventing a “too big to fail” effect. Overall, the financial situation in English football remains poor, a position that could be exacerbated by the economic crisis, caused by COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: The findings are not generalisable outside of the English football industry and the data is susceptible to usual accounting techniques and treatments. Practical implications: The paper recommends a re-distribution of broadcasting rights, on a more equal basis and incentivised with cost-reduction targets. The implementation of a hard salary cap at league level is also recommended to control costs. Furthermore, FFP regulations should be re-visited to deliver the original objectives of bringing about financial sustainability in European football. Originality/value: The paper extends the evidence base of measuring financial distress in professional team sports and is also the first paper of its kind to examine this in relation to Championship clubs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","English Premier League; English Professional Football; Financial Crisis; Financial Fair Play; Z-score","","","","","Abidali, Adnan Fadhil, A methodology for predicting company failure in the construction industry, Construction Management and Economics, 13, 3, pp. 189-196, (1995); Allan, Stephen, Satellite television and football attendance: The not so super effect, Applied Economics Letters, 11, 2, pp. 123-125, (2004); Altman, Edward I., ZETATM analysis A new model to identify bankruptcy risk of corporations, Journal of Banking and Finance, 1, 1, pp. 29-54, (1977); Journal of Accountancy, (1974); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., Predicting financial distress of companies: Revisiting the Z- Score and ZETA® models, pp. 428-455, (2013); Asian Journal of Management Research, (2012); Bachmaier, Birgit, Regulatory intensity in english and german professional football: A comparative analysis of national requirements for ensuring financial stability, Sport, Business and Management: An International Journal, 8, 3, pp. 276-297, (2018); Baimbridge, Mark J., Satellite broadcasting and match attendance: The case of rugby league, Applied Economics Letters, 2, 10, pp. 343-346, (1995); Baimbridge, Mark J., Satellite television and the demand for football: A whole new ball game?, Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 43, 3, pp. 317-333, (1996)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","09675426","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095720704"

Three novelties are proposed to support the reconfigured method. First, a parameterized approach for generating apt positive and negative IVHF reference solutions is proposed, which permits decision makers (DMs) to express their different aspiration strengths for fitting complex and uncertain decision scenarios and situations. Second, a novel distance for IVHF elements is constructed based on the modification of Wave-Hedges measurement to address the defects of the previous hesitant distances and to measure the separations of alternatives in TOPSIS. Third, a nine-step solution procedure of IVHF-TOSPSIS method is reconfigured to solve effectively the general problem that the ratings and weights are expressed with IVHF information.

Design/methodology/approach: This study computes bank’s cost, profit, revenue, technical, pure technical and scale efficiency within intermediation approach with data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a performance indicator, followed by exploring the association between income diversification and bank performance using truncated Tobit regression within panel data framework. Findings: Tobit regression results revealed inverted U-shaped relationship between the income diversification and estimated efficiency parameters for the overall panel. Size and bank intermediation ratio seems to be a major factor in exploiting the potential benefits of income diversification. The author reconfirmed the inverted U-shaped relationship with these efficiency parameters for exclusive subsamples consisting of government-owned and private sector banks. Research limitations/implications: Inverted U-shaped relationship between the income diversification and estimated efficiency parameters suggest that banks should go for limited diversification to improve performance. Thus, regulators and banks should pursue limited diversification strategy for improving banking efficiency.

However, three challenges must be addressed in environmental pollution management. First, the reliability of environmental pollution data is often disregarded, which may produce unreliable inference results. Second, there are many uncertainties in actual practice, which are neglected in existing cost prediction and efficiency evaluation of environmental pollution management. Third, existing research studies mainly focused on either efficiency evaluation or cost prediction and ignored the importance of combining both for environmental pollution management. To address these, an extended belief rule base (EBRB) model that considers consequence reliability is proposed to predict the interval costs, followed by an interval data envelopment analysis (IDEA) model that considers undesirable output to evaluate interval efficiencies of environmental pollution management. Based on these improved models, an integrated model named as EBRB–IDEA model is further developed under interval uncertainty. To verify its practical usage, the environmental pollution data of 29 Chinese provinces from 2004 to 2017wereused to carry out acase study. The experimental results demonstrated that the EBRB–IDEA model did not only achieve the desired interval prediction costs and efficiency evaluation but also effectively distinguished regional differences in the efficiency of environmental pollution management compared with existing models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cost Prediction; Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency Evaluation; Environmental Pollution Management; Extended Belief Rule Base; Interval Uncertainty; Cost Benefit Analysis; Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency; Forecasting; Pollution; Reliability Analysis; Uncertainty Analysis; Efficiency Evaluation; Environmental Pollutions; Integrated Modeling; Interval Efficiency; Interval Prediction; Interval Uncertainty; Regional Differences; Research Studies; Environmental Management","Cost benefit analysis; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Forecasting; Pollution; Reliability analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Efficiency evaluation; Environmental pollutions; Integrated modeling; Interval efficiency; Interval prediction; Interval uncertainty; Regional differences; Research studies; Environmental management","","","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61773123 , 71701050 , 71801050 , and 71872047 ), the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education, China (No. 20YJC630188 ), the Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (No. FJ2019C032 and FJ2018C014 ), and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (No. 2016J05171 ).","Charnes, Abraham, Measuring the efficiency of decision making units, European Journal of Operational Research, 2, 6, pp. 429-444, (1978); Chen, Lei, An investment analysis for China's sustainable development based on inverse data envelopment analysis, Journal of Cleaner Production, 142, pp. 1638-1649, (2017); Chen, Lei, A two-stage network data envelopment analysis approach for measuring and decomposing environmental efficiency, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 119, pp. 388-403, (2018); Costa-Campi, Maria Teresa, What are the determinants of investment in environmental R&D?, Energy Policy, 104, pp. 455-465, (2017); Ebrahimi, Bohlool, Efficiency bounds and efficiency classifications in imprecise DEA: An extension, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 71, 3, pp. 491-504, (2020); Mianabadi, Hojjat, Intelligent multi-stakeholder environmental management, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 1, pp. 862-866, (2011); Hosseinzadeh-Bandbafha, Homa, Application of data envelopment analysis approach for optimization of energy use and reduction of greenhouse gas emission in peanut production of Iran, Journal of Cleaner Production, 172, pp. 1327-1335, (2018); Lepori, Gabriele Mario, Air pollution and stock returns: Evidence from a natural experiment, Journal of Empirical Finance, 35, pp. 25-42, (2016); Levy, Tamir, Air pollution and stock returns in the US, Journal of Economic Psychology, 32, 3, pp. 374-383, (2011); Liu, Hongbo, Research on the coordinated development of greenization and urbanization based on system dynamics and data envelopment analysis——A case study of Tianjin, Journal of Cleaner Production, 214, pp. 195-208, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083333851"

Bone-related operations have become the largest percentage of surgeries, accounting for 40% of the top 10 operations in the United States. Further, these spine-related operations are now ranked second among all bone-related operations. Due to this enormous and daily increasing market demand, more and more firms have started to pay closer attention to related medical devices and products. The global venture capitalists (VCs) have also started to follow the mega trend and will continue to invest heavily in this industry. Although most VCs recognize that investing in firms that produce innovative spinal products or devices is a must, very few practical managers or research scholars have defined the appropriate evaluation methods for these firms to use. The traditional net present value (NPV) method, which does not consider operation flexibility and changes in strategy, is far from the reality. The real option method can reveal the vagueness and flexibilities of the values being embedded in the investment projects at spinal medical device firms. However, the real option method is strictly quantitative. Usually, the evaluation aspects contain qualitative factors or local criteria which are hard to quantify in monetary terms. Thus, the adoption of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods that can manipulate both quantitative and qualitative factors will be very helpful in evaluating and selecting investment cases like the spinal medical device firms, where both quantitative and qualitative factors should be considered. An analytical framework that consists of hybrid MCDM methods and the real option method will thus be very useful to evaluate the newly established firms producing spinal medical devices. Therefore, the authors propose a real option valuation as well as the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based analytic network process (DANP) and the modified VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method (DANP-mV) based MCDM framework for evaluating the investment projects offered by these firms of spinal medical devices. An empirical study based on three newly established spinal medical device companies specializing in vertebral compression fracture (VCF) surgical devices was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed analytical framework. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of modeling parameters on ranking results of alternatives. This analytical framework can thus serve as a tool for VCs to use to determine the value of a potential candidate for investment. The proposed method can also serve as an effective and efficient tool for investment projects in other fields. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biotechnology; Multiple Criteria Decision Making (mcdm); Real Option Analysis; Spinal Device; Venture Capitalists (vcs); Bone; Equipment; Investment; Medicine; Multicriteria Analysis; Article; Commercial Phenomena; Compression Fracture; Delphi Study; Feasibility Study; Firm; Human; Market; Multicriteria Decision Analysis; Named Groups By Occupation; Sensitivity Analysis; Spine Surgery; Venture Capitalist; Devices; Economics; Empirical Research; Manufacturing Industry; Methodology; Spine Fracture; United States; Empirical Research; Equipment And Supplies; Fractures, Compression; Humans; Investments; Manufacturing Industry; Research Design; Spinal Fractures","bone; equipment; investment; medicine; multicriteria analysis; Article; commercial phenomena; compression fracture; Delphi study; feasibility study; firm; human; market; multicriteria decision analysis; named groups by occupation; sensitivity analysis; spine surgery; venture capitalist; devices; economics; empirical research; manufacturing industry; methodology; spine fracture; United States; Empirical Research; Equipment and Supplies; Fractures, Compression; Humans; Investments; Manufacturing Industry; Research Design; Spinal Fractures","","","This article was subsidized by the Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), Taiwan and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan under Grant no.

This study proposes a method for accident prediction that fully captures these natures based on historical data and prior knowledge. The method utilizes the relatively high occurrence frequency of precursor events and the dependency between precursors and accidents. The modeling approach consists of three steps: (1) characterize the stochastic occurrences of precursor events over time based on precursor data; (2) estimate the failure rate of the Poisson model which is assumed to be a prior distribution of accident occurrences; and (3) elicit the expert knowledge about the stochastic dependency between near miss occurrences and accident occurrences. A copula-based Markov model is used to develop the time series model of precursors while a copula-based protocol is proposed to aid expert judgment elicitation and quantification. The probability of accident occurrence is then dynamically updated according to the observed historical near miss numbers. The proposed method is applied to a metro construction project. A five-year long near miss data were collected and used as accident precursor data, while three experts were invited to provide relevant information. The developed accident model is used to predict the accident-prone periods, which are consistent with the months that the observed near miss occurrence frequency deviates significantly from normality. Thus, the model can be used to support the planning of necessary safety improvement programs before the accident risk increased. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction Safety; Copula Method; Dynamic Analysis; Incident Occurrence Frequency; Probability Model; Dynamic Analysis; Failure Analysis; Markov Processes; Poisson Distribution; Stochastic Models; Stochastic Systems; Subways; Traffic Control; Construction Accidents; Construction Safety; Copula Method; Incident Occurrence Frequency; Occurrence Frequency Of Precursors; Probabilistic Analysis; Probability Modeling; Stochastic Dependencies; Accidents","Dynamic analysis; Failure analysis; Markov processes; Poisson distribution; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Subways; Traffic control; Construction accidents; Construction safety; Copula method; Incident occurrence frequency; Occurrence frequency of precursors; Probabilistic analysis; Probability modeling; Stochastic dependencies; Accidents","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grant No. 51608399 .","undefined, (2019); undefined, (2019); undefined, (2019); Hinze, Jimmie W., Leading indicators of construction safety performance, Safety Science, 51, 1, pp. 23-28, (2013); Alexander, Dillon, Precursors of construction fatalities.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on comment data of individual stock from the Snowball, a thermal optimal path method is employed to analyze the lead–lag relationship between investor attention (IA) and the stock price. And machine learning algorithms, including SVM and BP neural network, are used to predict the prices of certain kind of stock. Findings: It turns out that the lead–lag relationships between IA and the stock price change dynamically. Forecasting based on investor behavior is more accurate only when the IA of the stock is stably leading its price change most of the time. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this paper is that it studies China’s stock market only; however, different conclusions could be drawn for other financial markets or mature stock markets. Practical implications: As for the implications, the new tool could improve the prediction accuracy of the model, thus have practical significance for stock selection and dynamic portfolio management. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first few research works that introduce individual investor data into portfolio risk management. The new tool put forward in this study can capture the dynamic interplay between IA and stock price change, which help investors identify and control the risk of their portfolios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Investor Attention; Risk Management; Svm; Thermal Optimal Path Method; Backpropagation; Commerce; Electronic Trading; Financial Markets; Forecasting; Risk Management; Bp Neural Networks; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic Portfolios; Investor Attention; Optimal Paths; Portfolio Risk Management; Prediction Accuracy; Trend Forecasting; Investments","Backpropagation; Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Risk management; BP neural networks; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic portfolios; Investor attention; Optimal paths; Portfolio risk management; Prediction accuracy; Trend forecasting; Investments","","","","Antweiler, Werner, Is all that talk just noise?

However, the issue how entrepreneurs' social networks influence on corporate risk contagion is still received limited attention from scholars. In this study, a framework is proposed to describe entrepreneurs' interaction and corporate value creation. The main results of multiagent simulations indicate the following. First, either weak ties or strong connections of social networks can enhance density of corporate risk contagion. However, only strong connections can be moderated by entrepreneurs' risk preference. Second, weak ties improve risk exposure of individual corporations, while strong connections may probably decrease systematical risk of the market. Third, weak ties are important for mature corporations to achieve business success. However, for startups, strong connections are more valuable to maintain. The findings of this study not only provide theoretical support from some widely accepted economic phenomenon but also provide explanations for conflicting results from some previous literatures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Success; Corporate Values; Dynamic Evaluation; Limited Attentions; Multi Agent Simulation; Risk Exposure; Risk Preference; Simulation Approach; Risk Management","Business success; Corporate values; Dynamic evaluation; Limited attentions; Multi agent simulation; Risk exposure; Risk preference; Simulation approach; Risk management","","","","Doornich, June Borge, Managerial learning from social capital during internationalization, International Business Review, 27, 4, pp. 877-892, (2018); Abdulahad, Raika, Measuring Social Capital: An Adaptation and Translation into Arabic of the Onyx and Bullen Social Capital Scale for Iraqi-Canadians, Australian Social Work, 71, 4, pp. 462-477, (2018); Zheng, Victor W.T., The mystery of capital: Eurasian entrepreneurs' socio-cultural strategies for commercial success in early 20th-century Hong Kong, Asian Studies Review, 34, 4, pp. 467-487, (2010); Fornoni, Mariel, Universidad social capital and the competitiveness of entrepreneurs: A review of the literature and proposals, pp. 247-268, (2008); Batjargal, Bat, Entrepreneurs' access to private equity in China: The role of social capital, Organization Science, 15, 2, pp. 159-172, (2004); Chou, Tzuchuan, The impacts of social capital on information technology outsourcing decisions: A case study of a Taiwanese high-tech firm, International Journal of Information Management, 26, 3, pp. 249-256, (2006); Buechel, Berno, The dynamics of continuous cultural traits in social networks, Journal of Economic Theory, 154, pp. 274-309, (2014); Journal of Entrepreneurship Management, (2017); Ferris, Stephen P., CEO social capital, risk-taking and corporate policies, Journal of Corporate Finance, 47, pp. 46-71, (2017); Hartmann, Evi, Opportunism risk in service triads - a social capital perspective, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 44, 3, pp. 242-256, (2014)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","10990526; 10762787","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098753760"

In order to achieve a sustainable business in the international construction market, contractors require an average to high return yield under high-risk conditions. This study aims to reveal what risk factors and risk management performance enables high-risk projects to yield high returns. The study investigated 124 international construction projects by Korean contractors and classified them into four groups: high-risk high-return (HH), high-risk low-return (HL), low-risk high-return (LH), and low-risk low-return (LL). The study found that risk assessment accuracy was the most important trigger in discriminating between high return projects (HH, LH) and low return projects (HL, LL), whereas risk mitigation performance showed little difference between high return and low return projects. In addition, the contingency amount did not significantly affect project return in HL, LH, and LL projects, but HH projects showed a positive relation between contingency and predicted risk amount. This article contributes to recognizing the differences between high return and low return projects and provides insights for practitioners into the relation between risk management performance and high returns in different risk conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contingency; International Construction Project; Risk And Return; Risk Assessment; Risk Mitigation; Construction Industry; Project Assessment; Risk Assessment; Risk Factor","construction industry; project assessment; risk assessment; risk factor","","","This work was supported by a grant funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean government (19SCIP-C079445-06)","Merton, Robert C., On estimating the expected return on the market: An exploratory investigation, 8, 4, pp. 323-361, (1980); Financial Institutions Management, (2000); Connolly, Joseph P., Discussion of ""modeling a contractor's markup estimation"" by Min Liu and Yean Yng Ling, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 132, 6, pp. 657-658, (2006); Chiara, Nicola, Infrastructure risk management in renewable energy projects using risk flexibility theory, pp. 1174-1183, (2009); Smith, Gary R., Small to medium contractor contingency and assumption of risk, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 125, 2, pp. 101-108, (1999); Laryea, Samuel, How contractors price risk in bids: Theory and practice, Construction Management and Economics, 26, 9, pp. 911-924, (2008); Qazi, Abroon, Project Complexity and Risk Management (ProCRiM): Towards modelling project complexity driven risk paths in construction projects, International Journal of Project Management, 34, 7, pp. 1183-1198, (2016); Han, Seungheon, Predicting profit performance for selecting candidate international construction projects, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 133, 6, pp. 425-436, (2007); Liu, Junying, Risk paths in international construction projects: Case study from Chinese contractors, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 142, 6, (2016); Lee, Kang-wook, Country selection model for sustainable construction businesses using hybrid of objective and subjective information, Sustainability (Switzerland), 9, 5, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074856636"

These measures often exhibit heavily skewed distribution because of the presence of outliers. In the absence of clear definition of outliers, ad hoc approaches can be found in the literature for identifying and handling extreme values. However, it is not clear how these different approaches can affect the predictive power of models. There seems to be consensus in the literature on the necessity of handling outliers, at the same time, it is not clear how to define extreme values to be handled in order to maximize the predictive power of models. There are two possible ways to reduce the bias originating from outliers: omission and winsorization. Since the first approach has been examined previously in the literature, we turn our attention to the latter. We applied the most popular classification methodologies in this field: discriminant analysis, logistic regression, decision trees (CHAID and CART) and neural networks (multilayer perceptron). We assessed the predictive power of models in the framework of tenfold stratified crossvalidation and area under the ROC curve. We analyzed the effect of winsorization at 1, 3 and 5% and at 2 and 3 standard deviations, furthermore we discretized the range of each variable by the CHAID method and used the ordinal measures so obtained instead of the original financial ratios. We found that this latter data preprocessing approach is the most effective in the case of our dataset. In order to check the robustness of our results, we carried out the same empirical research on the publicly available Polish bankruptcy dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We obtained very similar results on both datasets, which indicates that the CHAID-based categorization of financial ratios is an effective way of handling outliers with respect to the predictive performance of bankruptcy prediction models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bankruptcy Prediction; Cart; Chaid; Data Preprocessing; Decision Trees; Neural Networks; Winsorizing; Artificial Neural Network; Bankruptcy; Data Processing; Decision Support System; Machine Learning; Model Test; Outlier; Performance Assessment; Prediction","artificial neural network; bankruptcy; data processing; decision support system; machine learning; model test; outlier; performance assessment; prediction","","","","Tsai, Chihfong, Simple instance selection for bankruptcy prediction, Knowledge-Based Systems, 27, pp. 333-342, (2012); Journal of Accounting Research, (1966); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Bemš, Július, Innovative default prediction approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 17-18, pp. 6277-6285, (2015); Zhang, Jie, The effect of introducing economic variables into credit scorecards: An example from invoice discounting, Journal of Risk Model Validation, 9, 1, pp. 57-78, (2015); Blanco, Antonio, Credit scoring models for the microfinance industry using neural networks: Evidence from Peru, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 1, pp. 356-364, (2013); Frydman, Halina, Introducing Recursive Partitioning for Financial Classification: The Case of Financial Distress, Journal of Finance, 40, 1, pp. 269-291, (1985); Lee, Sangjae, A multi-industry bankruptcy prediction model using back-propagation neural network and multivariate discriminant analysis, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 8, pp. 2941-2946, (2013); Twala, Bhekisipho, Multiple classifier application to credit risk assessment, Expert Systems with Applications, 37, 4, pp. 3326-3336, (2010); Cao, Yu X., MCELCCh-FDP: Financial distress prediction with classifier ensembles based on firm life cycle and Choquet integral, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 8, pp. 7041-7049, (2012)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00380121","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054091837"

A key factor that most investors in the construction sector consider in project selection is cost which has escalated over the years. Therefore, we examine the co-movements and causality in the time and frequency domains between the prime building cost index (PBCI) and its disaggregates on one hand and inflation and exchange rate on the other hand in Ghana. The findings revealed that the degree of co-movement between PBCI and inflation was significant at the 5% level and occurred over the long-run, indicating that construction cost drives inflation. The degree of co-movement between the prime build cost index and exchange rate occurred within the short term. These co-movements have policy implications for substituting inflation and exchange rates in project costing by investors in Ghana. The co-movement between the PBCI and inflation in the medium to higher frequencies suggests that inflation risk-averse investors should consider short-term projects. Again, the short to medium frequency co-movements between the PBCI and exchange rate indicates that investors should consider exchange rate risk in long-term projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Exchange Rate; Frequency Domain; Ghana; Non-food Consumer Price Index; Prime Building Cost Index; Time Domain; Wavelet Analysis; Construction Industry; Cost Benefit Analysis; Costs; Information Services; Public Policy; Time Domain Analysis; Wavelet Analysis; Building Cost Indices; Consumer Price Index; Exchange Rates; Frequency Domains; Ghana; Time Domain; Frequency Domain Analysis; Building; Cost Analysis; Exchange Rate; Inflation; Macroeconomics; Wavelet Analysis","Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Information services; Public policy; Time domain analysis; Wavelet analysis; Building cost indices; Consumer price index; Exchange rates; Frequency domains; Ghana; Time domain; Frequency domain analysis; building; cost analysis; exchange rate; inflation; macroeconomics; wavelet analysis","","","","Abdullah, Ahmad Monir, The impact of crude oil price on Islamic stock indices of South East Asian countries: Evidence from MGARCH-DCC and wavelet approaches, Borsa Istanbul Review, 16, 4, pp. 219-232, (2016); undefined, (2014); Journal of Science and Technology, (2010); Akintoye, Akintola S., Analysis of factors influencing project cost estimating practice, Construction Management and Economics, 18, 1, pp. 77-89, (2000); Akintoye, Akintola S., Macro-economic leading indicators of construction contract prices, Construction Management and Economics, 16, 2, pp. 159-175, (1998); Building Estimating Manual for West Africa, (1996); Andrieş, Alin Marius, Comovement of Exchange Rates: A Wavelet Analysis, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 52, 3, pp. 574-588, (2016); Ashuri, Baabak, Time series analysis of ENR construction cost index, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 136, 11, pp. 1227-1237, (2010); Cost Studies of Buildings, (1999); Bekiros, Stelios D., On the time scale behavior of equity-commodity links: Implications for portfolio management, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 41, pp. 30-46, (2016)","","Routledge info@tandf.co.uk","","","","","","01446193; 1466433X","","CMECF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055325224"

Two-step system generalized method of moment dynamic panel estimator is applied to nonfinancial sector's data from Pakistan Stock Exchange over the period 2001–2014. The results imply that stock return volatility has a significant negative impact on book leverage and long-term market leverage ratios. However, stock return volatility causes the increase in total market leverage ratios. Moreover, book leverage and long-term market leverage of firms decrease as a result of an increase in stock return volatility in different classification of firms. Conversely, stock return volatility has a significant positive impact on total market leverage ratios in those classifications of firms. Capital structure decisions are more sensitive to stock return volatility as default risk increases. Firms significantly go for the reduction in their debt financing due to high stock returns volatility and to avoid from possible consequences of default. The results are robust to alternative measures such as cash flow volatility and earnings volatility. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Structure Measures; Dynamic Panel Model; Nonfinancial Firms; Stock Return Volatility; System Gmm; Capital Market; Estimation Method; Numerical Model; Panel Data; Stock Market; Pakistan","capital market; estimation method; numerical model; panel data; stock market; Pakistan","","","","Abor, Joshua Yindenaba, The effect of capital structure on profitability: an empirical analysis of listed firms in Ghana, Journal of Risk Finance, 6, 5, pp. 438-445, (2005); Akhtar, Shumi, Capital structure and business cycles, Accounting and Finance, 52, SUPPL.1, pp. 25-48, (2012); African Journal of Business Management, (2010); Amidu, Mohammed, Does bank competition and diversification lead to greater stability?

It presents a holistic view of the fundamentals right at the start that will aid the reader in understanding the concepts of risk and why they need to be analyzed to more advanced topics of strategic risk management. The author does this by adopting a widely accepted risk framework that uses financial risk as a common thread weaving through the entire enterprise risk management process to illustrate its workings. Therefore, the aim of this book is three-fold: First, it discusses the concept in a generic analytical framework of managerial decision-making. As the basic principles of risk management have been intermeshed with the generally accepted enterprise risk management framework, this implicitly warrants the discussion of the corporate environments in which risks exist, namely, the operational and financial systems. The second objective is to detail the enterprise risk management process in the context of a firm with a focus on financial risk exposure. Third, the risk management strategies are discussed; their relevance, methods and application are presented. This book also provides a framework for analyzing key financial risks and a guide for implementing risk controls in an enterprise risk management context. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Corporate Finance, (1997); Central European, (1997); Ahmed, Ehsan, Complex bubble persistence in closed-end country funds, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 32, 1, pp. 19-37, (1997); Comparing Financial Systems, (2000); Exchange Rate Risk Management Evidence from East Asia, (2000); Altman, Edward I., The success of business failure prediction models.

In the past decades, China has built a large number of high dams and large reservoirs that are extremely difficult for operation and management. It is therefore necessary and urgent to carry out profound researches on the joint dispatching technology of cascaded water conservancy projects with the consideration of dam safety, ancillary facilities safety, generating unit's safety, near dam reservoir areas safety and flood discharge safety. Nevertheless, the safety management of cascaded water conservancy projects is an extremely risk decision task since it involves in a broadly wide range of risk issues and highly nonlinear problems. Actually, the risk of large water conservancy projects has posed a challenge to their long-term safety and stable operation. The author has long been engaged in the operation management of water conservancy projects. Therefore, he has rich experience on the risk management. In the article, the author reveals the deficiency of the current management mode based on many years of practice on operation management of huge water conservancy projects, and further summarizes the potential risks stem from different sources during the joint operation of cascaded water conservancy projects. More importantly, the author systematically reviews the existing technology for risk identification and safety status discriminant in a real-time manner, as well as analyzes their technical feasibility. Besides that, the technical challenges faced by the safe operation of those huge water conservancy projects are analyzed in detail, and the future research direction is pointed out as well. In order to facilitate top-level design, the author also formulates the risk management content and proposes workflow of ""identification-monitoring-analysis- early warning-regulation"" for cascaded water conservancy projects from the perspective of multi-source risks management.

The results show that firms initiating international business operations via earnout-financed CBAs enhance their value more than acquirers in (a) domestic acquisitions and (b) remaining CBAs by established multinational corporations (MNCs). Our findings demonstrate the superiority of earnout financing in CBAs announced by acquirers that have no prior international business experience. The results are robust to the firms' endogenous choice to diversify globally and to the use of earnout financing. We contend that earnouts contribute to the reduction of valuation risk faced by firms acquiring a foreign target firm for the first time.

Methods: The research was conducted on the data set of Slovak corporations covering the period of the year 2015, and two mathematical statistical methods were applied. The methods are logit and probit, which are both symmetric binary choice models, also known as conditional probability models. On the other hand, these methods show some significant differences in process of model formation, as well as in achieved results. Findings & Value added: Given the fact that mostly discriminant analysis and logistic regression are used for the construction of bankruptcy prediction models, we have focused our attention on the development bankruptcy prediction model in the Slovak Republic via logistic regression and probit. The results of the study suggest that the model based on a logit functions slightly outperforms the classification accuracy of probit model. Differences were obtained also in the detection of the most significant predictors of bankruptcy prediction in these types of models constructed in Slovak companies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bankruptcy; Financial Health; Logit; Probit; Slovak Companies","","","","This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under Grant number APVV-14-0841: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies.","Proceedings of the 8th International Scientific Conference Managing and Modelling of Financial Risks, (2016); Proceedings of 17 Th International Scientific Conference Finance and Risk, (2015); South Asian J Glob Bus Res, (2016); Antonowicz, Pawel, The multi-dimensional structural analysis of bankruptcy of enterprises in Poland in 2013 – results of empirical studies, Journal of International Studies, 7, 1, pp. 35-45, (2014); Archer, Kellie J., Goodness-of-fit test for a logistic regression model fitted using survey sample data, Stata Journal, 6, 1, pp. 97-105, (2006); Bewick, Viv, Statistics review 14: Logistic regression, Critical Care, 9, 1, pp. 112-118, (2005); Quarterly Journal of Economics and Economic Policy, (2014); Boratyńska, Katarzyna, Corporate bankruptcy and survival on the market: Lessons from evolutionary economics, Oeconomia Copernicana, 7, 1, pp. 107-129, (2016); Eastern European Economics, (1993); Brożyna, Jacek, Statistical methods of the bankruptcy prediction in the logistics sector in Poland and Slovakia, Transformations in Business and Economics, 15, 1, pp. 93-114, (2016)","","Institute of Economic Research","","","","","","1689765X; 23533293","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045105819"

We examine anchor investors’ investment in initial public offerings (IPOs) to determine how they create value for issuing firms and participating investors. Using a database of 135 IPOs issued in the Indian market through book building mechanism during 2009–2014, we find that anchor investors’ investment in IPOs reduces underpricing. Larger subscription from retail investors for anchor-supported IPOs indicates that anchor investors’ participation is viewed as a credible attestation of quality of the issue. We document that anchor-supported IPOs are more liquid and less volatile in the short run. We also find that by controlling for other factors such as offer size, subscription rate and age of the firm, a part of the underpricing is reduced by anchor investors. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age Of The Firm; Anchor Investor; Ipo; Liquidity; Market Condition; Offer Size; Subscription Rate; Underpricing; Volatility","","","","","Agarwal, Sumit, Investor demand for IPOs and aftermarket performance: Evidence from the Hong Kong stock market, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 18, 2, pp. 176-190, (2008); Aggarwal, Rajesh K., The impact of fundamentals on IPO valuation, Financial Management, 38, 2, pp. 253-284, (2009); Financial Management, (1993); Barry, Christopher B., The role of venture capital in the creation of public companies.

I followed existing methodology in the extant literature by using cross-sectional absolute dispersion (CSAD) to detect industry-wide herding and industry leader-follower herding, as well as the herding behavior during economic expansion and contraction during the sample period 1996–2015. Using industry median capital structure measurement, statistically significant evidence of herding in Services industry is found in the bear market, whilst statistically significant evidence of herding in the bull market is found in Manufacturing industry when industry-leader capital structure measurement is used. Given the relatively high procyclical nature of services industry, it is not all surprising that corporate financial managers may herd around industry median capital structure during economic contraction for reasons such as indemnity against suboptimal performance and reputational costs. On the other hand, in a bull market coupled with information asymmetry, firms may engage in free-riding and this might explain herd behavior exhibited by manufacturing industry. Regarding inter-industry herd behavior, all three industries are found to herd around the Wholesale industry; two are found to herd around manufacturing and construction industries. With the exception of manufacturing industry, none of the other three industries exhibit within-industry herding behavior using both industry median and industry leader capital structure measurements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Finance; Capital Structure; Cross-sectional Absolute Dispersion; Herd Behavior","","","","","Avery, Christopher Norio, Multidimensional Uncertainty and Herd Behavior in Financial Markets, American Economic Review, 88, 4, pp. 724-748, (1998); Baker, Malcolm P., Global, local, and contagious investor sentiment, Journal of Financial Economics, 104, 2, pp. 272-287, (2012); Banerjee, Abhijit V., A simple model of heed behavior, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107, 3, pp. 797-817, (1992); Barberis, Nicholas C., Style investing, Journal of Financial Economics, 68, 2, pp. 161-199, (2003); Ben-Rephael, Azi, Measuring investor sentiment with mutual fund flows, Journal of Financial Economics, 104, 2, pp. 363-382, (2012); Bikhchandani, Sushil, A theory of fads, fashion, custom, and cultural change as informational cascades, Journal of Political Economy, 100, 5, pp. 992-1026, (1992); Bikhchandani, Sushil, Herd behavior in financial markets, IMF Staff Papers, 47, 3, pp. 279-310, (2000); Blasco, Natividad, Market sentiment: A key factor of investors' imitative behaviour, Accounting and Finance, 52, 3, pp. 663-689, (2012); Working Paper, (2004); Boyson, Nicole M., Implicit incentives and reputational herding by hedge fund managers, Journal of Empirical Finance, 17, 3, pp. 283-299, (2010)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","01486195","","JEBUD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028724999"

Following 6Ws’ systematic review design and protocol, we survey the taxonomy of research published over the past three decades in international business, strategic management, finance, and economics. We present our syntheses in seven strands: macroeconomic and financial markets environment, institutional and regulatory environment, political environment and corruption, tax and the taxation environment, accounting standards and valuation guidelines, cultural environment, and geographical environment. Our integrative review and discussions are framed through Home–Host country, West–South, and South–West directional flows. We then show some highlights of the bibliometric analysis, provide a summary for each country-level determinant, and offer several theoretical propositions and research directions in need of future exploration. The review suggests that better the host country's institutional laws with regard to financial markets, taxation and corporate governance, then higher the number of inward acquisitions. It emphasizes that geopolitical distance, regulatory distance, and cultural distance between developed and developing economies are more likely to be moderated by the target country's market size, natural resources base, and weak institutional laws, especially corporate tax and capital gains tax.

The findings indicate that the announcement of cross-border M&As results in a positive stock market reaction; this effect is more significant in the mainland Chinese stock markets (Shanghai and Shenzhen) than that in the Hong Kong market.

Previous research in this regard has focused on the technical and engineering aspects of infrastructure construction. The risk management of resilient transport infrastructure is poorly considered, and little has been done to quantify the capacity of transport infrastructure to recover from the impact of natural disasters under varying conditions. This paper applies Cox’s proportional hazards regression model to determine the rate of recovery and cumulative probability that recovery occurs for transport infrastructure across regional areas in New South Wales, Australia. Data for post-disaster reconstruction projects over the period 1992–2012 are used to analyze recovery rate against geographic region, natural disaster type and post-disaster transport infrastructure reconstruction cost. Results demonstrate that transport infrastructure recovered slowest when the failure is the result of a flood rather than bushfire or storm, and in regions with a riverine geography. To validate the accuracy of the model, a bootstrap resampling technique is used.

The study includes several brands differing in supply chain structure, product variety and seasonality. Design/methodology/approach – Longitudinal data on supply chain transactions and customer weather conditions are analysed. The underlying hypothesis is that changes in weather affect demand, which in turn impacts supply chain performance. Findings – In general, an increase in temperature in winter and spring decreases order volumes in resorts, while for larger customers in urban locations order volumes increase. Further, an increase in volumes of non-seasonal products reduces delays in deliveries, but for seasonal products the effect is opposite. In all, weather affects demand, lower volumes do not generally improve supply chain performance, but larger volumes can make it worse. The analysis shows that the dependence structure between demand and delay is time varying and is affected by weather conditions. Research limitations/implications – The study concerns one country and leisure goods, which can limit its generalizability. Practical/implications – Well-managed supply chains should prepare for demand fluctuations caused by weather changes. Weekly weather forecasts could be used when planning operations for product families to improve supply chain performance. Originality/value – The study focuses on supply chain vulnerability in normal weather conditions while most of the existing research studies major events or catastrophes. The results open new opportunities for supply chain managers to reduce weather dependence and improve profitability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Demand Variation; Seasonal Products; Supply Chain Management And Performance; Weather","","","","","Aviv, Yossi, The effect of collaborative forecasting on supply chain performance, Management Science, 47, 10, pp. 1326-1343, (2001); Bahng, Youngjin, The relationship between temperature and sales: Sales data analysis of a retailer of branded women's business wear, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 40, 6, pp. 410-426, (2012); Barbounis, Thanasis G., Long-term wind speed and power forecasting using local recurrent neural network models, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 21, 1, pp. 273-284, (2006); Beamon, Benita M., Measuring supply chain performance, International Journal of Operations and Production Management, 19, 3, pp. 275-292, (1999); Behe, Bridget K., Should you blame the weather?

However, the prices are unstable and have been soaring since 2000. Therefore, research on the factors affecting real estate price in China has great practical significance. In this paper, related research achievements from domestic and foreign scholars on the subject are evaluated. Then, the latest statistical data from 2000 to 2014 is selected and analyzed. Further, a real estate price model affecting house price change has been established through a multiple linear regression method, obtaining the conclusion: Real estate price change has shown a greater correlation to urbanization, commercial house sales, and the use-of foreign investments for real estate development enterprise than other related factors. In response, therefore, the government should enlarge its supervision over real estate development and sales links, promote coordinated development between real estate and urbanization, and regulate the utilization behavior and financing channels of foreign estate development enterprises on foreign investment to promote the stability of house prices in China. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Apartment Houses; Architectural Design; Costs; Economics; Houses; Linear Regression; Office Buildings; Regional Planning; Regression Analysis; Foreign Investment; Multiple Linear Regression Method; Multivariate Linear Regression Model; Real Estate Development; Real Estate Industries; Real Estate Prices; Research Achievements; Statistical Datas; Investments","Apartment houses; Architectural design; Costs; Economics; Houses; Linear regression; Office buildings; Regional planning; Regression analysis; Foreign investment; Multiple linear regression method; Multivariate linear regression model; Real estate development; Real estate industries; Real estate prices; Research achievements; Statistical datas; Investments","","","","Finance Economics, (2013); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2015); Guide to Business, (2013); Kaplanski, Guy, Real estate prices: An international study of seasonality's sentiment effect, Journal of Empirical Finance, 19, 1, pp. 123-146, (2012); Research on Influence of Real Estate Price in China, (2013); Journal of Economics and Sustainable Development, (2011); Enterprise Reform and Management, (2015); Impact of Investor Sentiments on Real Estate Prices, (2013); Technology and Enterprise, (2015); Science and Technology Square, (2014)","Wang, Y.; Al-Hussein, M.; Shen, G.Q.P.; Zhu, Y.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) onlinejls@asce.org","Modernization of Management Committee of the China Construction Industry Association; The Construction Institute (CI) of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","2016 International Conference on Construction and Real Estate Management, ICCREM 2016","","Edmonton; AB","129905","","9780784480274","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029580277"

The value creation can be via new innovations, more effective production processes, taking benefit of the synergy effects in various functions, and so on (see e.g. Deeds and Hill 1996; Barringer and Harrison 2000). The literature on IJV research shows that internal partner factors (Brouthers and Bamossy 2006) and the interaction between partners often significantly influence the cooperation. In addition, the effect of location factors on the operations of firms has been emphasized in international business research (Miller and Eden 2006). However, the current literature related to value creation in strategic alliances and IJVs provides relatively limited empirical results about these influences. Lee et al. (2013) found that value creation differs between alliances located in developing and developed countries. Furthermore, prior research suggests that resource complementarity between partners enhances the value creation potential in IJVs (Kumar 2008). Previous studies (e.g. Pothukuchi et al. 2002) suggest that both national and organizational cultural differences also play a crucial role in the operation and effectiveness of IJVs. Some studies (e.g. Hennart and Zheng 2002; Pothukuchi et al. 2002) have found that cultural differences have a negative impact on IJV operations, and some others (e.g. Li et al. 2001) have found a positive influence. Besides, interactions between partners, such as inter-partner flexibility, communication, trust, and control mechanisms, seem to be important factors that impact upon IJV operations (Vaidya 2000). On the one hand, several IJVs do not reach the value creation goals set for them and the units are therefore subsequently terminated (Christoffersen 2013); on the other hand, the earlier results of the value creation effects of several variables are mixed. Therefore it is important to investigate more fully the impact of various inter-partner and location related variables on value creation in IJVs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Ainuddin, Raja Azimah Omar, Resource attributes and firm performance in international joint ventures, Journal of World Business, 42, 1, pp. 47-60, (2007); Amici, Alessandra, Value creation in banking through strategic alliances and joint ventures, Journal of Banking and Finance, 37, 5, pp. 1386-1396, (2013); Journal of Marketing, (1990); Ariño, África, Relational quality: Managing trust in corporate alliances, California Management Review, 1, pp. 109-131, (2001); Cooperative Strategies and Alliances, (2002); Aulakh, Preet S., Trust and performance in cross-border marketing partnerships: A behavioral approach, Journal of International Business Studies, 27, 5, pp. 1005-1032, (1996); Barringer, Bruce R., Walking a tightrope: Creating value through interorganizational relationships, Journal of Management, 26, 3, pp. 367-403, (2000); Baughn, C.

Such little research has been concerned with civil uprisings and revolutionary movements, as crucial sources of political uncertainty. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of political uncertainty (resulting from the Tunisian Revolution) on the volatility of major sectorial stock indices in the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE). Design/methodology/approach – The authors apply the fractionally integrated exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model (FIEGARCH), which helps maintain a direct shock-persistence as well as a shock asymmetric volatility measurement. This model is applied to the daily returns relevant to nine sectorial stock indices and to the Tunisian benchmark index (TUNINDEX) with respect to three sub-periods (before, during and follows the Tunisian Revolution). Findings – The reached findings suggest that the shock impact throughout the Revolution period on construction, industries, consumer services, financial services, financial companies indices’ sectorial and the TUNINDEX return volatilities have proven to be permanent, while its persistence on the other indices has been discovered to be transitory. In addition, the achieved results appear to reveal a low leverage effect on all indices. This result seems to be very important since the Tunisian Revolution turns out to have a very important effect on the TSE. Originality/value – The paper’s empirical contribution lies in using the FIEGARCH approach to model the Tunisian sectorial indices’ volatility dynamics, persistence degree and leverage effect. This contribution goes a long way in helping regulators and international investors to further recognize the extent to which political instability does participate in affecting the TSE. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Markets; Politics","","","","","British Journal of Economics Management and Trade, (2013); Inflation in Tunisia Perception and Reality in A Context of Transition, (2012); Aisen, Ari, Does political instability lead to higher inflation?

In investment, usually venture capitalists use different strategies to obtain the maximum returns. Due to its advantages to reduce the information asymmetry and agency cost, stage financing is widely used by venture capitalists. Although considerable attentions are devoted to stage financing, very little is known about the risk aversion strategies of IT projects. This paper mainly addresses the problem of risk aversion of venture capital investment in IT projects. Based on the analysis of characteristics of venture capital investment of IT projects, this paper introduces a real option pricing model to measure the value brought by the stage financing strategy and design a risk aversion model for IT projects. Because real option pricing method regards investment activity as contingent decision, it helps to make judgment on the management fexibility of IT projects and then make a more reasonable evaluation about the IT programs. Lastly by being applied to a real case, it further illustrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Commercial Phenomena; Computer Program; Financial Management; Funding; Information Technology; Investment; Program Effectiveness; Program Feasibility; Risk Management; Human; Theoretical Model; Humans; Investments; Models, Theoretical","Article; commercial phenomena; computer program; financial management; funding; information technology; investment; program effectiveness; program feasibility; risk management; human; theoretical model; Humans; Investments; Models, Theoretical","","","","Chinese Journal of Management Science, (2002); Chinese Journal of Management Science, (2005); Management World, (2001); Chinese Journal of Management Science, (2001); Sahlman, William A., The structure and governance of venture-capital organizations, Journal of Financial Economics, 27, 2, pp. 473-521, (1990); Gompers, Paul A., An analysis of compensation in the U.S. venture capital partnership, Journal of Financial Economics, 51, 1, pp. 3-44, (1999); Wang, Susheng, Staged financing in venture capital: Moral hazard and risks, Journal of Corporate Finance, 10, 1, pp. 131-155, (2004); Financial Structure and Control in Venture Capital, (1994); Li, Yong, Duration analysis of venture capital staging: A real options perspective, Journal of Business Venturing, 23, 5, pp. 497-512, (2008); Gompers, Paul A., Optimal Investment, Monitoring, and the Staging of Venture Capital, Journal of Finance, 50, 5, pp. 1461-1489, (1995)","","Hindawi Limited 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb New York NY 10022","","","","","","1537744X; 23566140","","","25147845","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930613873"

The reasons, which produce these characteristics, are analyzed from three points including the industry, national macro policies and ownership structure. Studies show that there are three characteristics in the China real estate industry: existence of many undistributed dividend companies in the past years, cash dividend mainly used for the form of dividend payment, and continuously declining dividend payout ratio. The dividend policy is extremely unstable and relatively discontinuous in the intra-industry.

This is not the case with the construction industry. This industry is characterized by high fragmentation, very low market shares of even the largest corporations and hardly any potential for gaining market power through acquisitions. Nevertheless, the construction industry shows intensive M&A activity and the question arises whether these transactions are favorable for the bidding companies. The results document remarkably positive long-run stock price performances for acquirers within the construction industry. These results do not only account for strategic bidders, but also for the construction industry diversifying lateral acquisitions. This success is mainly driven by the transaction characteristics of the profitability, capital structure, payment media and the kind of takeover. © Dirk Schiereck, Joachim Vogt, 2013. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction Industry; Long-term Bidder Gains; Strategic Mergers And Acquisitions; Success Parameters","","","","","Agrawal, Anup, The Post‐Merger Performance of Acquiring Firms: A Re‐examination of an Anomaly, Journal of Finance, 47, 4, pp. 1605-1621, (1992); Amihud, Yakov, Conglomerate mergers, managerial motives and stockholder wealth, Journal of Banking and Finance, 10, 3, pp. 401-410, (1986); Andrade, Gregor, New evidence and perspectives on mergers, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 15, 2, pp. 103-120, (2001); Mergers Acquisitions, (1992); Housing and Construction A Troubled Relationship, (1996); Barlow, James G., Organisational learning and inter-firm “partnering” in the UK construction industry, Learning Organization, 5, 2, pp. 86-98, (1998); Beach, Roger, An evaluation of partnership development in the construction industry, International Journal of Project Management, 23, 8, pp. 611-621, (2005); Bickel, Peter J., Resampling fewer than n observations: Gains, losses, and remedies for losses, Statistica Sinica, 7, 1, pp. 1-31, (1997); Black, Carolynn, Analysis of success factors and benefits of partnering in construction, International Journal of Project Management, 18, 6, pp. 423-434, (2000); Bresnen, Mike J., Partnering in construction: A critical review of issues, problems and dilemmas, Construction Management and Economics, 18, 2, pp. 229-237, (2000)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","17277051; 18105467","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894142546"

This study evaluates the value creation from these cross-border transactions from two representative emerging countries, namely China and India, and determines factors that result in the different performance of these international acquisition activities. Cross-border acquisitions conducted by these countries' companies indeed lead to significant shareholder wealth creation. Furthermore, Indian shareholders are more likely to benefit from deals in small cultural distance countries, while Chinese investors gain from the cross-border expansion of manufacturing companies. Location also affects the performance of cross-border acquisitions, with acquisitions into developed countries generating higher returns to shareholders.

This is the first known study to test statistically the connection between sustainability innovations and the market value of companies in the construction sector. An event study model is used to analyse sustainability innovation announcements and financial information of large construction sector companies in a number of countries. The main finding of the analysis is that a positive and statistically significant association exists between sustainability innovation announcements and the market value of companies in the construction sector. According to the results, sustainability innovation announcements explain an increase of 0.82% in the market capitalization of the studied companies. The findings are in line with earlier studies suggesting that investments of construction sector companies in sustainability can lead to the creation of economic value. The results imply that sustainability innovations are relevant to the top management of companies operating in the construction sector regarding business development. In addition, information on sustainability innovations can be useful to stock market investors for assessing the future growth potential of construction companies. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Performance; Construction Firms; Construction Sector; Innovation; Market Value; Sustainability; Business Development; Business Innovation; Business Performance; Construction Companies; Construction Firms; Construction Sectors; Economic Values; Event Studies; Financial Information; Growth Potential; Market Capitalization; Market Values; Stock Market; Top Management; Commerce; Construction Industry; Economics; Finance; Innovation; Sustainable Development","Business development; Business innovation; Business performance; Construction companies; Construction firms; Construction sectors; Economic values; Event studies; Financial information; Growth potential; Market capitalization; Market values; Stock market; Top management; Commerce; Construction industry; Economics; Finance; Innovation; Sustainable development","","","","Ahern, Kenneth R., Sample selection and event study estimation, Journal of Empirical Finance, 16, 3, pp. 466-482, (2009); Ambec, Stéfan, Does it pay to be green?

The objectives of the present paper, are therefore to identify the current state-of-practice in managing foreign exchange exposure. To present a wide perspective the analysis includes questionnaire surveys regarding foreign exchange exposure in three different sectors. The three sectors are: international special purpose companies engaged in project financing; large-scale international construction companies; and highly export-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises, all based in Singapore. The analysis demonstrates that all three sectors are exposed to a degree of foreign exchange risk. The paper also demonstrates that foreign exchange exposure is not as very well managed as it might be. The three sectors might have different needs in protecting their cash flow from foreign exchange exposure but the analysis could help them learn from one another in identifying common trends and drawing universal conclusions where appropriate. To improve on the presently identified state-of-practice, various foreign exchange risk mitigation techniques more commonly used, their perceived effectiveness, and factors of concern in using them, are discussed. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Construction Industry; Currency Risk Control; Foreign Exchange Exposure; Hedging; Hedging Techniques; International Construction Firms; Public Private Partnerships; Small To Medium-sized Enterprises","","","","","Bartram, Söhnke M., A primer on the exposure of non-financial corporations to foreign exchange rate risk, Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 15, 4-5 SPEC.

Many theories exist regarding the motivation towards initiation of a corporate takeover by acquisition bidding. This study has examined three major motivations of corporate acquisitions (hostile, hubris, and synergy) separately and measured the market performance of bidding firm over a long-horizon period. Bidders and targets are identified from a sample of completed UK takeovers between the period 1990 and 1998 that accurately reflect a specific merger motive. The findings show that the performance in the post-acquisition period depends on the main driving force behind the acquisition. The conclusions presented in this paper add new evidence to the post-acquisition dilemma by postulating that the underlying motives behind the takeover is related to the performance of the bidder over the long-horizon. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abhyankar, Abhay H., Long-run post-merger stock performance of UK acquiring firms: A stochastic dominance perspective, Applied Financial Economics, 15, 10, pp. 679-690, (2005); Agrawal, Anup, The Post‐Merger Performance of Acquiring Firms: A Re‐examination of an Anomaly, Journal of Finance, 47, 4, pp. 1605-1621, (1992); Agrawal, Anup, Executive Careers and Compensation Surrounding Takeover Bids, Journal of Finance, 49, 3, pp. 985-1014, (1994); Barber, Brad M., Detecting long-run abnormal stock returns: The empirical power and specification of test statistics, Journal of Financial Economics, 43, 3, pp. 341-372, (1997); Berkovitch, Elazar, Motives for takeovers: An empirical investigation, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 28, 3, pp. 347-362, (1993); Billett, Matthew T., The takeover deterrent effect of open market share repurchases, Journal of Finance, 62, 4, pp. 1827-1850, (2007); Brown, Stephen J.C., Using daily stock returns.

Banks must evaluate credit risk of credit applicants by using standardized (external rating institutions) or internal ratings-based (IRB) methods. Banks which decided to use IRB method attempt to develop precise internal credit rating models for the evaluation of creditworthiness of their borrowers. The internal rating method for the estimation of default probability requires to collect the default information from the historical data in banks. The major studies about default determinating factors are based on classification methods (Zhou, Xie, Yuan, 2008). A classification model considers the default measurement as the pattern recognition where all borrowers are divided to non-default and default groups based on their financial and non financial data. Banks attempt to construct an evaluation model that can be used to discriminate new sample. This research focuses on a credit rating model development which could attribute credit ratings for Lithuanian companies. The steps of a model's development and improvement process are described in this paper. The model's development begins with the selection of initial variables (financial ratios) characterizing default and non-default companies. 20 financial ratios of 5 years were calculated according to annual financial reports. Then statistical and artificial intelligence methods were selected for the classification of companies into two groups: default and non-default. A discriminant analysis, logistic regression and artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron) were applied for this purpose. Often statistical methods are not able to operate with a large amount of data, so the analysis of variance, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and factor analysis were applied for data reduction. Artificial neural networks often are able to analyze a large amount of data so variable selection was accomplished by the network itself calculating ranks of importance for every initial variable. There were constructed 15 classification models and their classification accuracy was measured by calculating correct classification rates. The most accurate was a logistic regression model analyzing data of 3 years (97% of correctly classified companies). Then the sample of companies was supplemented with new data and changes in classification accuracy were estimated. The significant decrease of classification accuracy conditioned the need of model update. For this reason the logistic regression coefficients were recalculated. In order to classify non-default companies into 7 classes: profitability, liquidity, financial structure and individual possibility of default estimated by a logistic regression model were determined as rating criterions. Then the rating scale was constructed and credit ratings were attributed for companies in the sample. The calculated probabilities of default indicated that some lower ratings have lower probabilities of default. These imperfections were corrected by the modification of a rating scale. The research has shown that the developed model is a valid tool for the estimation of credit risk. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank; Classification Methods; Credit Ratings; Credit Risk","","","","","Angelini, Eliana, A neural network approach for credit risk evaluation, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 48, 4, pp. 733-755, (2008); Arslan, Özgür, Credit risks and internationalization of SMEs, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 10, 4, pp. 361-368, (2009); Azadeh, Ali H., Forecasting electrical consumption by integration of Neural Network, time series and ANOVA, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 186, 2, pp. 1753-1761, (2007); Boguslauskas, Vytautas, Evaluation of criteria for the classification of enterprises, Engineering Economics, 2, pp. 119-127, (2010); Boguslauskas, Vytautas, Estimation of credit risk by artificial neural networks models, Engineering Economics, 4, 64, pp. 7-14, (2009); Butera, Giovanni, An integrated multi-model credit rating system for private firms, Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 27, 3, pp. 311-340, (2006); Danėnas, Paulius, Support vector machines and their application in credit risk evaluation process, Transformations in Business and Economics, 8, 3 SUPPL.

Changes in demand-supply because of various factors are another phenomenon that occurs in the housing market. It is considered that these changes in demand-supply are closely related to the unsold new housing stocks. Therefore, we analyze the relationship between demandsupply in the housing market and unsold new housing stocks using the vector error correction model. We used data from Seoul as the spatial scope of this study, and the temporal scope of time series data ranged from July 2001 to July 2009. To obtain the time series data, databases of the Ministry of Land, Transport and Marine Affairs, Statistics Korea, CERIK, and Kookmin Bank were utilized. The results of variance decomposition analyses indicated that for changes in unsold new housing stocks, the explanatory powers of housing selling price indexes and housing loans were high while the explanatory powers of production factors were relatively low. Based on the results of impulse response analyses, the quantity of unsold new housing stocks showed larger changes in response to the impulses of housing prices and housing loans than to the impulse of production factors. Also, it was indicated that, among the production factors, unsold new housing stocks showed a pattern of continued change in relation to the financing status of suppliers while showing impromptu responses to the impulses of the material or manpower situation but no continued change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Housing Demand; Housing Supply; Unsold New Housing Stocks; Vector Error Correction Model; Commerce; Construction Industry; Error Correction; Factor Analysis; Impulse Response; Time Series; Construction Business; Demand And Supply; Housing Supply; Impulse Response Analysis; Production Factors; Unsold New Housing Stocks; Variance Decomposition; Vector Error Correction Model; Housing","Commerce; Construction industry; Error correction; Factor analysis; Impulse response; Time series; Construction business; Demand and supply; Housing supply; Impulse response analysis; Production factors; Unsold new housing stocks; Variance decomposition; Vector error correction model; Housing","","","","Gan, Quan, Measuring housing affordability: Looking beyond the median, Journal of Housing Economics, 18, 2, pp. 115-125, (2009); Oikarinen, Elias, Household borrowing and metropolitan housing price dynamics - Empirical evidence from Helsinki, Journal of Housing Economics, 18, 2, pp. 126-139, (2009); Sing, Tien Foo, Price dynamics in public and private housing markets in Singapore, Journal of Housing Economics, 15, 4, pp. 305-320, (2006); Riddel, Mary, Housing-market disequilibrium: An examination of housing-market price and stock dynamics 1967-1998, Journal of Housing Economics, 13, 2, pp. 120-135, (2004); Kim, Kyung-hwan, Housing and the Korean economy, Journal of Housing Economics, 13, 4 SPEC.ISS., pp. 321-341, (2004); Malpezzi, Stephen, The long-run price elasticity of supply of new residential construction in the United States and the United Kingdom, Journal of Housing Economics, 10, 3, pp. 278-306, (2001); Glaeser, Edward, Housing supply and housing bubbles, Journal of Urban Economics, 64, 2, pp. 198-217, (2008); Ayuso, Juan, House prices and rents: An equilibrium asset pricing approach, Journal of Empirical Finance, 13, 3, pp. 371-388, (2006); Case, Karl E., Comparing wealth effects: The stock market versus the housing market, Advances in Macroeconomics, 5, 1, (2005); Ortalo-Magné, François N., Housing transactions and macroeconomic fluctuations: A case study of England and Wales, Journal of Housing Economics, 13, 4 SPEC.ISS., pp. 287-303, (2004)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13472852; 13467581","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649578035"

Companies often internationalize their financial areas as part of their larger internationalization strategy. In other words, such an initiative is associated with the internationalization of non-financial business areas. However, the move to financial internationalization may also obey a specific strategy designed to take advantage of the opportunities offered by increasingly global financial milieus and markets. Then again, of course, it may respond to a combination of the two, in which case all the factors mentioned are likely to exercise some influence. Design/methodology/approach – To test these propositions, a sample of 461 firms located in the Basque Country (Northern Spain), were analyzed between 16 June and 13 July 2004. Primary data were collected by telephone surveys, with a specially designed questionnaire tested previously with a number of pilot businesses. The sample represents a confidence level of 95 percent and 4.25 percent as a maximum level of error. This sample was divided by company size and the sector each business worked in, maintaining, approximately, proportionality in each stratum with respect to the population. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests and logit analysis were used, among others. Findings – Companies most likely to go into debt abroad are larger and more internationalized commercially and in production. First are large exporting companies with one or more production facilities abroad (PFA), which are followed by: medium enterprises that export and which have at least one PFA and large companies that export but which have no PFA. The profile of firms with foreign shareholders begins with manufacturing companies that import, followed by commercial businesses that also import. One interesting feature is the low number of companies in the construction industry and the services sector, particularly the ones that neither export nor import. Research limitations/implications – A sample of 461 firms located in the Basque Country (Northern Spain) were analyzed and thus the sample might be geographically limited. Also, the degree of financial internationalization of these firms is relatively low. A sample which covers a greater amount of financially internationalized firms, might have led to more solid conclusions. Practical implications – The most noteworthy practical implication of the paper is the confirmation that Basque firms still do not clearly perceive opportunities for financial internationalization. The barriers and risks to be faced beyond geographical borders weigh heavily. In other words, the threats companies are exposed to outweigh potential opportunities in international markets, or the conditions for financing and domestic financial investment available are in general more favourable than the conditions obtainable abroad. Originality/value – Within the Basque firms, even if the commercial, supply and production internationalization has been analyzed at length, the financial internationalization has not. Moreover, the profiles of financially internationalized firms have not been analyzed previously on the basis of a different sample. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Finance; Globalization; International Business; International Finance; Small To Medium-sized Enterprises; Spain","","","","","Andersson, Svante, Internationalization in different industrial contexts, Journal of Business Venturing, 19, 6, pp. 851-875, (2004); When does Capital Account Liberalization Help More than It Hurts, (2001); Las Empresas Vascas Frente A Los Mercados Exteriores, (2003); Beckers, Stan, National versus global influences on equity returns, Financial Analysts Journal, 52, 2, pp. 31-39, (1996); Bekaert, Geert, Time‐Varying World Market Integration, Journal of Finance, 50, 2, pp. 403-444, (1995); Bekaert, Geert, Foreign speculators and emerging equity markets, Journal of Finance, 55, 2, pp. 565-613, (2000); Bekaert, Geert, Emerging markets finance, Journal of Empirical Finance, 10, 1-2, pp. 3-55, (2003); Belso-Martínez, José Antonio, Why are some Spanish manufacturing firms internationalizing rapidly?

However, the lending amounts to the construction industry decreased much more sharply in spite of an increased monetary supply. Hence, the loose monetary policy has not reduced the financial constraints of the construction firms in Taiwan. In this paper, we investigate how the credit channel of monetary policy works in the Taiwan construction industry. We explain the reasons for financial constraints in the construction industry in Taiwan. Construction firms, whose information is considerably opaque, are likely to be viewed as “lemons,” which accounts for the credit crunch policy of banking lending to these construction firms. Two strands of evidence support this view. First, the borrowing terms for the construction industry have been more restrictive than those for other industrial firms during the same period of financial difficulty. Second, we determine that such financial constraints vary systematically within different industry groups. The results substantiate that construction firms retain more internal funds for future investment, and the sign of the liquidity coefficient is significant in their investment function. The evidence shows construction firms bear most of the reductions in bank loan supply, and that they are more bank-dependent. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank-dependent; Borrowing Terms; Constrained Investment; Construction Industry; Credit Channel","","","","This study has been supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan (Grant No. NSC 90-2416-H-035-005: Does Financial Liberalization Make Firms and Banks More Risky?

The drivers of house prices include income, the housing stock, demography, credit availability, interest rates, and lagged appreciation, the latter a potential mechanism for overshooting. There is rather less agreement on the determinants of new construction, though planning constraints are widely seen as a major issue and one of the causes of the UK housing affordability problem. The paper argues that housing collateral and downpayment constraints are the key to understanding the role of house-price variations in explaining medium-term consumption fluctuations. Institutional variations between countries and over time account for major differences in linkages between house prices and economic activity. This illuminates debates about how monetary and other policy should react to house-price variations. The paper also discusses the role of housing markets in explaining regional migration and location decisions, intergenerational inequality, and restricting access of the less affluent to public goods, such as good schools, which are capitalized in local house prices. © The Authors 2008.
